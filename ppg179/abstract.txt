I believe the first data point (4.09) is actually 34.09 (search for '4.09' and see that the numerous Npart values that match except for the first occurence.

When the data is arranged in the order of smallest to largest, it is called ascending order. Thus, ascending order means a sorting method in which the sort starts from the lowest to the highest.

title:
Measurement of higher cumulants of net-charge multiplicity distributions in Au + Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 7.7–200 GeV.

abstract:
We report the measurement of cumulants ($C_{n}$, $n$ = 1, . . . ,4) of the net-charge distributions measured within
pseudorapidity (|$\eta$| < 0.35) in Au + Au collisions at
$\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 7.7–200 GeV with the PHENIX experiment at
the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider. The ratios of cumulants (e.g., $C_1/C_2$, $C_3/C_1$) of the net-charge distributions,
which can be related to volume independent susceptibility ratios, are studied as a function of centrality and energy. These quantities are important to understand the quantum-chromodynamics phase diagram and possible existence of a critical end point. The measured values are very well described by expectation from negative binomial distributions. We do not observe any nonmonotonic behavior in the ratios of the cumulants as a
function of collision energy. The measured values of $C_1/C_2$ and $C_3/C_1$ can be directly compared to lattice
quantum-chromodynamics calculations and thus allow extraction of both the chemical freeze-out temperature and the baryon chemical potential at each center-of-mass energy. The extracted baryon chemical potentials are in excellent agreement with a thermal-statistical analysis model.
