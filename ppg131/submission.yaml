  The PHENIX experiment has measured electrons and positrons at midrapidity from the decays of hadrons containing charm and bottom quarks produced in $d$+Au and $p$+$p$ collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV in the transverse-momentum range 0.85$\leq p^{e}_{T} \leq$8.5 GeV/c. In central $d$+Au collisions, the nuclear modification factor $R_{dA}$ at 1.5 < $p_{T}$ < 5 GeV/c displays evidence of enhancement of these electrons, relative to those produced in $p$+$p$ collisions, and shows that the mass-dependent Cronin enhancement observed at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider extends to the heavy $D$ meson family. A comparison with the neutral-pion data suggests that the difference in cold-nuclear-matter effects on light- and heavy-flavor mesons could contribute to the observed differences between the $\pi^{0}$ and heavy-flavor-electron nuclear modification factor $R_{AA}$.

The nuclear modification factors $R_{dA}$ and $R_{AA}$ for minimum bias $d$+Au and Au+Au collisions, for the $\pi^{0}$ and $e^{\pm}_{HF}$. The two boxes on the right side of the plot represent the global uncertainties in the $d$+Au (left) and Au+Au (right) values of $N_{coll}$ . An additional common global scaling uncertainty of 9.7% on $R_{dA}$ and $R_{AA}$ from the $p+p$ reference data is omitted for clarity.'
