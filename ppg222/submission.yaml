  The PHENIX experiment at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider has measured the differential cross section, mean transverse momentum, mean transverse momentum squared of inclusive $J/\psi$ and cross-section ratio of $\psi(2S)$ to $J/\psi$ at forward rapidity in $p$+$p$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 510 GeV via the dimuon decay channel. Comparison is made to inclusive $J/\psi$ cross sections measured at $\sqrt{s}$ = 200 GeV and 2.76-13 TeV. The result is also compared to leading-order nonrelativistic QCD calculations coupled to a color-glass-condensate description of the low-$x$ gluons in the proton at low transverse momentum ($p_T$) and to next-to-leading order nonrelativistic QCD calculations for the rest of the $p_T$ range. These calculations overestimate the data at low $p_T$. While consistent with the data within uncertainties above â‰ˆ 3 GeV/$c$, the calculations are systematically below the data. The total cross section times the branching ratio is BR $d{\sigma^{J/\psi}_{pp}}/dy$(1.2 < $|y|$ < 2.2, 0 < $p_T$ < 10 GeV/$c$) = 54.3 $\pm$ 0.5 (stat) $\pm$ 5.5 (syst) nb.
