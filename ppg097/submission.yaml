  We report the measurement of the transverse momentum dependence of inclusive $J/\psi$ polarization in $p$+$p$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 200 GeV performed by the PHENIX Experiment at RHIC. The polarization is studied in the helicity, Gottfried-Jackson, and Collins-Soper frames for $p_T$ < 5 GeV/$c$ and $|y|$ < 0.35. The J/psi polarization in the helicity and Gottfried-Jackson frames is consistent with zero for all transverse momenta, with a slight (1.8 sigma) trend towards longitudinal polarization for transverse momenta above 2 GeV/$c$. No conclusion is allowed due to the limited acceptance in the Collins-Soper frame and the uncertainties of the current data. The results are compared to observations for other collision systems and center of mass energies and to different quarkonia production models.
