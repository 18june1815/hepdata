  Differential measurements of the elliptic ($v_2$) and hexadecapole ($v_4$) Fourier flow coefficients are reported for charged hadrons as a function of transverse momentum ($p_T$) and collision centrality or the number of participant nucleons ($N_{part}$) for Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV. The $v_{2,4}$ measurements at pseudorapidity $|\eta|$ $\le$ 0.35 obtained with four separate reaction plane detectors positioned in the range 1.0 < $|\eta|$ < 3.9 show good agreement, indicating the absence of significant $\eta$-dependent nonflow perturbations. Sizable values for $v_4(p_T)$ are observed with a ratio ${v_4(p_T,N_{part})}/{v_2^2(p_T,N_{part})}$ $\approx$ 0.8 for 50 $\le$ $N_{part}$ $\le$ 200, which is compatible with the combined effects of a finite viscosity and initial eccentricity fluctuations. For $N_{part}$ $\ge$ 200 this ratio increases up to 1.7 in the most central collisions.
