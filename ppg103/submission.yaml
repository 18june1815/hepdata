  We report the first measurement of transverse single-spin asymmetries in $J/\psi$ production from transversely polarized $p$+$p$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 200 GeV with data taken by the PHENIX experiment in 2006 and 2008. The measurement was performed over the rapidity ranges 1.2 < $|y|$ < 2.2 and $|y|$ < 0.35 for transverse momenta up to 6 GeV/$c$. $J/\psi$ production at RHIC is dominated by processes involving initial-state gluons, and transverse single-spin asymmetries of the $J/\psi$ can provide access to gluon dynamics within the nucleon. Such asymmetries may also shed light on the long-standing question in QCD of the $J/\psi$ production mechanism. Asymmetries were obtained as a function of $J/\psi$ transverse momentum and Feynman-$x$, with a value of -0.086 $\pm$ 0.026$^{stat}$ $\pm$ 0.003$^{syst}$ in the forward region. This result suggests possible nonzero trigluon correlation functions in transversely polarized protons and, if well defined in this reaction, a nonzero gluon Sivers distribution function.
