  The PHENIX experiment presents results from the RHIC 2005 run with polarized proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 200 GeV, for inclusive $\pi^0$ production at mid-rapidity. Unpolarized cross section results are given for transverse momenta $p_T$ = 0.5 to 20 GeV/$c$, extending the range of published data to both lower and higher $p_T$. The cross section is described well for $p_T$ < 1 GeV/$c$ by an exponential in $p_T$, and, for $p_T$ > 2 GeV/$c$, by perturbative QCD. Double helicity asymmetries $A_{LL}$ are presented based on a factor of five improvement in uncertainties as compared to previously published results, due to both an improved beam polarization of 50%, and to higher integrated luminosity. These measurements are sensitive to the gluon polarization in the proton, and exclude maximal values for the gluon polarization.
