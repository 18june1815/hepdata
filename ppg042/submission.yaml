    The first measurement of direct photons in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV is presented. The direct photon signal is extracted as a function of the Au+Au collision centrality and compared to NLO pQCD calculations. The direct photon yield is shown to scale with the number of nucleon-nucleon collisions for all centralities.

description: 'Double ratio of measured $(\gamma/\pi^0)_{Measured}$ invariant yield ratio to the background decay $(\gamma/\pi^0)_{Background}$ ratio as a function of $p_T$ for minimum bias and for five centralities of Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV. The bin range is not an uncertainty in the x-axis because the actual uncertainty by having the finite bin width is corrected for by the bin-shift correction. These bins were constructed using the corrected finite values as centers.'
