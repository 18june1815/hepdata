  The PHENIX collaboration has measured $\phi$ meson production in $d$+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV using the dimuon and dielectron decay channels. The $\phi$ meson is measured in the forward (backward) $d$-going (Au-going) direction, 1.2 < $y$ < 2.2 (−2.2 < $y$ < −1.2) in the transversemomentum ($p_T$) range from 1–7 GeV/$c$, and at midrapidity $|y|$ < 0.35 in the $p_T$ range below 7 GeV/$c$. The $\phi$ meson invariant yields and nuclear-modification factors as a function of $p_T$, rapidity, and centrality are reported. An enhancement of $\phi$ meson production is observed in the Au-going direction, while suppression is seen in the $d$-going direction, and no modification is observed at midrapidity relative to the yield in $p$+$p$ collisions scaled by the number of binary collisions. Similar behavior was previously observed for inclusive charged hadrons and open heavy flavor indicating similar cold-nuclear-matter effects.
