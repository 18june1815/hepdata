  We report on event structure and double helicity asymmetry ($A_{LL}$) of jet production in longitudinally polarized $p$+$p$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 200 GeV. Photons and charged particles were measured by the PHENIX experiment at midrapidity $|\chi|$ < 0.35 with the requirement of a high-momentum (>2 GeV/$c$) photon in the event. Event structure, such as multiplicity, $p_T$ density and thrust in the PHENIX acceptance, were measured and compared with the $pythia$ event generator and $geant$ detector simulation. The shape of jets and the underlying event were well reproduced at this collision energy. For the measurement of jet $A_{LL}$, photons and charged particles were clustered with a seed-cone algorithm to obtain the cluster $p_T$ sum ($p^{reco}_T$). The effect of detector response and the underlying events on $p^{reco}_T$ was evaluated with the simulation. The production rate of reconstructed jets is satisfactorily reproduced with the NLO pQCD jet production cross section. For 4 < $p^{reco}_T$ < 12 GeV/$c$ with an average beam polarization of $<P>$ = 49%, we measured $A_{LL}$ = -0.0014 $\pm$ 0.0037$^{stat}$ at the lowest $p^{reco}_T$ bin (4-5 GeV/$c$) and -0.0181 $\pm$ 0.0282$^{stat}$ at the highest $p^{reco}_T$ bin (10-12 GeV/$c$) with a beam polarization scale error of 9.4% and a $p_T$ scale error of 10%. Jets in the measured $p^{reco}_T$ range arise primarily from hard-scattered gluons with momentum fraction 0.02 < $x$ < 0.3 according to $pythia$. The measured $A_{LL}$ is compared with predictions that assume various $\DeltaG(x)$ distributions based on the GRSV parameterization. The present result imposes the limit -1.1 < $\int_{0.02}^{0.30}dx\DeltaG$($x$,$\mu^2$ = 1 GeV$^2$) < 0.4 at 95% confidence level or $\int_{0.02}^{0.30}dx\DeltaG$($x$,$\mu^2$ = 1 GeV$^2$) < 0.5 at 99% confidence level.
