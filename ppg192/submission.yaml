  We present measurements of two-particle angular correlations between high-transverse-momentum ( 2< $p_T$ < 11 GeV/$c$) $\pi^0$ observed at midrapidity ($|\eta|$ < 0.35) and particles produced either at forward (3.1 < $\eta$ < 3.9) or backward (−3.7 < $\eta$ < −3.1) rapidity in $d$+Au and $p$+$p$ collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV. The azimuthal angle correlations for particle pairs with this large rapidity gap in the Au-going direction exhibit a ridge-like structure that persists up to $p_T$ ≈ 6 GeV/$c$ and which strongly depends on collision centrality, which is a similar characteristic to the hydrodynamical particle flow in A+A collisions. The ridge-like structure is absent in the $d$-going direction as well as in $p$+$p$ collisions, in the transverse-momentum range studied. The results indicate that the ridge-like structure is shifted in the Au-going direction toward more central collisions, similar to the charged-particle pseudorapidity distributions.
