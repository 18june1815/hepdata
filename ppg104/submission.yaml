  We report on charmonium measurements [$J/\psi$ (1S), $\psi^{\prime}$ (2S), and $\chi_c$ (1P)] in $p$+$p$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 200 GeV. We find that the fraction of $J/\psi$ coming from the feed-down decay of $\psi^{\prime}$ and $\chi_c$ in the midrapidity region ($|\eta|$ < 0.35) is 9.6 $\pm$ 2.4% and 32 $\pm$ 9%, respectively. We also report new, higher statistics $p_T$ and rapidity dependencies of the $J/\psi$ yield via dielectron decay in the same midrapidity range and at forward rapidity (1.2 < $|\eta|$ < 2.4) via dimuon decay. These results are compared with measurements from other experiments and discussed in the context of current charmonium production models.
