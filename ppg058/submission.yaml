comment: | # Information that applies to all data tables.
  We report on two-particle azimuthal angle correlations between charged hadrons at forward/backward (deuteron/gold going direction) rapidity and charged hadrons at mid-rapidity in deuteron-gold ($d$ + $Au$) and proton-proton ($p$ + $p$) collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ =200GeV. Jet structures are observed in the correlations which we quantify in terms of the conditional yield and angular width of away-side partners. The kinematic region studied here samples partons in the gold nucleus carrying nucleon momentum fraction $x$ ∼ 0.1 to ∼ 0.01. Within this range, we find no $x$ dependence of the jet structure in $d$ + $Au$ collisions.
