comment: | # Information that applies to all data tables.
  We report on two-particle azimuthal angle correlations between charged hadrons at forward/backward (deuteron/gold going direction) rapidity and charged hadrons at mid-rapidity in deuteron-gold ($d$ + $Au$) and proton-proton ($p$ + $p$) collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ =200GeV. Jet structures are observed in the correlations which we quantify in terms of the conditional yield and angular width of away-side partners. The kinematic region studied here samples partons in the gold nucleus carrying nucleon momentum fraction $x$ ∼ 0.1 to ∼ 0.01. Within this range, we find no $x$ dependence of the jet structure in $d$ + $Au$ collisions.

# This is Figure 1.
name: "Figure 1"
location: Data from Fig. 1 of PRL 96, 222301 (2006)
description: Azimuthal angle correlation functions. Note that the y-axis is zero-suppressed on the middle and bottom panels. In the additonal resource, the Gaussian widths from the fits and the signal to background ration integrated over $\pi$ - 1 < $\Delta\phi$ < $\pi$ + 1 are shown.

# This is Figure 2.
name: "Figure 2"
location: Data from Fig. 2 of PRL 96, 222301 (2006)
description: Conditional yields (CY) shown as a function of trigger particle pseudorapitidy for trigger particle $p_T$ from 2.5 to 4.0 and associated particle $p_T$ from 1.0 to 2.5 GeV/$c$. The additional $\pm$0.037 systematic error on the mid-rapidity $p+p$ point is from jet yield extraction. There is a 1% point-by-point systematical error on all points except central arm triggers. There is also a 10% systematic error for all data points due to the determination of associated particle efficiency. For $p + p$ point, forward and backward trigger are combined, so the results are identical.
