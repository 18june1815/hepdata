comment: | # Information that applies to all data tables.
  Deuteron-gold ($d$ + Au) collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider provide ideal platforms for testing QCD theories in dense nuclear matter at high energy. In particular, models suggesting strong saturation effects for partons carrying small nucleon momentum fraction ($x$) predict modifications to jet production at forward rapidity (deuteron-going direction) in $d$ + Au collisions. We report on two-particle azimuthal angle correlations between charged hadrons at forward/backward (deuteron/gold going direction) rapidity and charged hadrons at midrapidity in $d$ + Au and $p$ + $p$ collisions at $\sqrt{S_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV. Jet structures observed in the correlations are quantified in terms of the conditional yield and angular width of away-side partners. The kinematic region studied here samples partons in the gold nucleus with $x$ $\sim 0.1$ to $\sim 0.01$. Within this range, we find no $x$ dependence of the jet structure in $d$ + Au collisions.

# This is Figure 1.
name: "Figure 1"
location: Data from Fig. 1 of PRL 96, 222301 (2006)
description: Azimuthal angle correlation functions. Note that the y-axis is zero-suppressed on the middle and bottom panels. In the additonal resource, the Gaussian widths from the fits and the signal to background ration integrated over $\pi$ - 1 < $\Delta\phi$ < $\pi$ + 1 are shown.

# This is Figure 2.
name: "Figure 2"
location: Data from Fig. 2 of PRL 96, 222301 (2006)
description: Conditional yields (CY) shown as a function of trigger particle pseudorapitidy for trigger particle $p_T$ from 2.5 to 4.0 and associated particle $p_T$ from 1.0 to 2.5 GeV/$c$. The additional $\pm$0.037 systematic error on the mid-rapidity $p+p$ point is from jet yield extraction. There is a 1% point-by-point systematical error on all points except central arm triggers. There is also a 10% systematic error for all data points due to the determination of associated particle efficiency. For $p + p$ point, forward and backward trigger are combined, so the results are identical.
