comment: |
  Large parity violating longitudinal single-spin asymmetries $A^{e^+}_L$ = $-0.86^{+0.30}_{-0.14}$ and $A^{e^-}_L$ = $0.88^{+0.12}_{-0.71}$ are observed for inclusive high transverse momentum electrons and positrons in polarized $p + p$ collisions at a center of mass energy of $\sqrt{s}$ = 500 GeV with the PHENIX detector at RHIC. These $e^{\pm}$ come mainly from the decay of $W^{\pm}$ and $Z^0$ bosons, and their asymmetries directly demonstrate parity violation in the couplings of the $W^{\pm}$ to the light quarks. The observed electron and positron yields were used to estimate $W^{\pm}$ boson production cross sections for the $e^{\pm}$ channels of $\sigma$ $(pp \rightarrow W^+ X) \times BR(W^+ \rightarrow e^+\nu_e) = 144.1 \pm 21.2$(stat)$^{+3.4}_{-10.3}$(syst)$\pm 15\%(norm)$ pb, and $\sigma (pp \rightarrow W^- X) \times BR(W^- \rightarrow e^- \bar{\nu}_e)$ = 31.7 $\pm$12.1(stat)$^{+10.1}_{-8.2}$(syst) $\pm$ 15\%($norm$) pb.

# This is Figure 1.
name: "Figure 1"
location: Data from Figure 1 of Phys. Rev. Lett. 106, 062001 (2011)
description: The spectra of positive and negative candidates before and after an isolation cut. The computation of the background before the isolation cut is described in the text. The background band after the isolation cut is computed by scaling the background before the isolation cut by the isolation cut efficiency measured in the background region (12< $p_T$ <20GeV/$c$). The systematic errors include uncertainties in the photon conversion probability, the background normalization, and the background extrapoltion to $p_T$ > 30 GeV/$c$.
