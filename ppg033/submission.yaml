    Two particle correlations between identified meson and baryon trigger particles with 2.5 < $p_T$ < 4.0 GeV/$c$ and lower $p_T$ charged hadrons have been measured at midrapidity by the PHENIX experiment at RHIC in $p$+$p$, $d$+Au and Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV. The probability of finding a hadron near in azimuthal angle to the trigger particle is almost identical for leading mesons and baryons for non-central Au+Au. The yield for both trigger baryons and mesons is significantly higher in Au+Au than in $p$+$p$ and $d$+Au, except for trigger baryons in central collisions. The baryon excess is likely to arise predominantly from hard scattering processes.
