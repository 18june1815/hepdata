  Background: Heavy-flavor production in $p$+$p$ collisions tests perturbative-quantum-chromodynamics (pQCD) calculations. Modification of heavy-flavor production in heavy-ion collisions relative to binary-collision scaling from $p$+$p$ results, quantified with the nuclear-modification factor ($R_{AA}$), provides information on both cold- and hot-nuclear-matter effects. Purpose: Determine transverse-momentum, $p_T$, spectra and the corresponding $R_{AA}$ for muons from heavy-flavor mesons decay in $p$+$p$ and Cu+Cu collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=200 GeV and $y$=1.65. Method: Results are obtained using the semi-leptonic decay of heavy-flavor mesons into negative muons. The PHENIX muon-arm spectrometers measure the $p_T$ spectra of inclusive muon candidates. Backgrounds, primarily due to light hadrons, are determined with a Monte-Carlo calculation using a set of input hadron distributions tuned to match measured-hadron distributions in the same detector and statistically subtracted. Results: The charm-production cross section in $p$+$p$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=200$ GeV, integrated over $p_T$ and in the rapidity range $1.4<y<1.9$ is found to be $d\sigma_{c\bar{c}}/dy = 0.139 +/- 0.029$ (stat) $^{+0.051}_{-0.058}$ (syst) mb. This result is consistent with calculations and with expectations based on the corresponding midrapidity charm-production cross section measured earlier by PHENIX. The $R_{AA}$ for heavy-flavor muons in Cu+Cu collisions is measured in three centrality intervals for $1<p_T<4$ GeV/$c$. Suppression relative to binary-collision scaling ($R_{AA}<1$) increases with centrality. Conclusions: Within experimental and theoretical uncertainties, the measured heavy-flavor yield in $p$+$p$ collisions is consistent with state-of-the-art pQCD calculations. Suppression in central Cu+Cu collisions suggests the presence of significant cold-nuclear-matter effects and final-state energy loss.
