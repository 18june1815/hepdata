  We present inclusive charged hadron elliptic flow ($v_2$) measured over the pseudorapidity range $|\eta|$ < 0.35 in Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV. Results for $v_2$ are presented over a broad range of transverse momentum ($p_{T}$ = 0.2-8.0 GeV/$c$) and centrality (0-60%). To study nonflow effects that are correlations other than collective flow, as well as the fluctuations of $v_2$, we compare two different analysis methods: (1) the event-plane method from two independent subdetectors at forward ($|\eta|$ = 3.1–3.9) and beam ($|\eta|$ > 6.5) pseudorapidities and (2) the two-particle cumulant method extracted using correlations between particles detected at midrapidity. The two event-plane results are consistent within systematic uncertainties over the measured $p_T$ and in centrality 0–40%. There is at most a 20% difference in the $v_2$ between the two event-plane methods in peripheral (40–60%) collisions. The comparisons between the two-particle cumulant results and the standard event-plane measurements are discussed.
