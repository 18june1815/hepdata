  We present inclusive charged hadron elliptic flow ($v_2$) measured over the pseudorapidity range $|\eta| < $ 0.35 in \Au collisions at \sqsn = 200 GeV. Results for $v_2$ are presented over a broad range of transverse momentum (\pt = 0.2--8.0 GeV/$c$) and centrality (0--60\%). In order to study non-flow effects that are not correlated with the reaction plane, as well as the fluctuations of $v_2$, we compare two different analysis methods: (1) event plane method from two independent sub-detectors at forward ($|\eta|$ = 3.1--3.9) and beam ($|\eta| > 6.5$) pseudorapidities and (2) two-particle cumulant method extracted using correlations between particles detected at midrapidity.  The two event-plane results are consistent within systematic uncertainties over the measured \pt and in centrality 0--40\%. There is at most 20\% difference of the $v_2$ between the two event plane methods in peripheral (40--60\%) collisions.  The comparisons between the two-particle cumulant results and the standard event plane measurements are discussed.
