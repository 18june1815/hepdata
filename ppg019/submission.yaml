    The PHENIX experiment at RHIC has measured transverse energy and charged particle multiplicity at mid-rapidity in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 19.6, 130, and 200 GeV as a function of centrality. The presented results are compared to measurements from other RHIC experiments, and experiments at lower energies. The $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ dependence of $dE_T$/$d\eta$ and $dN_{ch}$/$d\eta$ per pair of participants is consistent with logarithmic scaling for the most central events. The centrality dependence of $dE_T$/$d\eta$ and $dN_{ch}$/$d\eta$ is similar at all measured incident energies. At RHIC energies the ratio of transverse energy per charged particle was found independent of centrality and growing slowly with $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$. A survey of comparisons between the data and available theoretical models is also presented.
