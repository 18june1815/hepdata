comment: | # Information that applies to all data tables.
  Transverse momentum spectra of electrons from Au$+$Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}$ = 130 GeV have been measured at midrapidity by the PHENIX experiment at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider. The spectra show an excess above the background from photon conversions and light hadron decays. The electron signal is consistent with that expected from semileptonic decays of charm. The yield of the electron signal $dN_{e}/dy$ for $p_{T} > 0.8$ GeV/c is 0.025 $\pm$ 0.004(stat) $\pm$ 6 0.010(syst) in central collisions, and the corresponding charm cross section is 380 $\pm$ 60(stat) $\pm$ 200(syst) $\mu$b per binary nucleon-nucleon collision.

# This is Figure 4.

location: Data from Fig. 4 of PRL 88, (192303) 2002
description: Single electron cross sections $\frac{d\sigma_e}{dy}|_{y=0}$ of this measurement and ISR experiments [9,11,31] are displayed (bottom of figure, right-hand scale) with charm decay contributions calculated with PYTHIA. Open and filled symbols for 1.0 < $p_T$ < 1.4 GeV/$c$ and $p_T$ > 1.4 GeV/$c$, respectively. The derived charm cross section of this measurement is compared with charm cross sections from SPS/FNAL experiments (top of figure, left-hand scale). The thick curve and the shaded band represent the charm cross section in the PYTHIA model and in a NLO pQCD calculation [30], respectively.
