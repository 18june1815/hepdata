comment: |
  The differential cross section for the production of direct photons in $p+p$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 200 GeV
  at midrapidity was measured in the PHENIX detector at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider.
  Inclusive-direct photons were measured in the transverse momentum range from 5.5–25 GeV/c,
  extending the range beyond previous measurements. Event structure was studied with an isolation
  criterion. Next-to-leading-order perturbative-quantum-chromodynamics calculations give a good
  description of the spectrum. When the cross section is expressed versus xT , the PHENIX data
  are seen to be in agreement with measurements from other experiments at different center-of-mass
  energies.

description:  (a) Inclusive direct photon spectra compared with
an NLO pQCD calculation for three different renormalization
and factorization scales as mentioned in the text (The same
calculation was used in [5]). The error bars denote pointby-point uncertainties, the error brackets show pT correlated
uncertainties. (b) Comparison of the data and the pQCD calculation.
