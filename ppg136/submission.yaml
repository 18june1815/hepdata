  The differential cross section for the production of direct photons in $p+p$ collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 200 GeV$ at midrapidity was measured in the PHENIX detector at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider. Inclusive-direct photons were measured in the transverse momentum range from $5.5–25 GeV/c$, extending the range beyond previous measurements. Event structure was studied with an isolation criterion. Next-to-leading-order perturbative-quantum-chromodynamics calculations give a good description of the spectrum. When the cross section is expressed versus $x_T$, the PHENIX data are seen to be in agreement with measurements from other experiments at different center-of-mass energies.
