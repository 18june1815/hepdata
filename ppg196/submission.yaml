  The cross section and transverse single-spin asymmetries of $\mu^âˆ’$ and $\mu^+$ from open heavy-flavor decays in polarized $p$+$p$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 200 GeV were measured by the PHENIX experiment during 2012 at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider. Because heavy-flavor production is dominated by gluon-gluon interactions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 200 GeV, these measurements offer a unique opportunity to obtain information on the trigluon correlation functions. The measurements are performed at forward and backward rapidity (1.4 < $|y|$ < 2.0) over the transverse momentum range of 1.25 < $p_T$ < 7 GeV/$c$ for the cross section and 1.25 < $p_T$ < 5 GeV/$c$ for the asymmetry measurements. The obtained cross section is compared to a fixed-order-plus-next-to-leading-log perturbative-quantum-chromodynamics calculation. The asymmetry results are consistent with zero within uncertainties, and a model calculation based on twist-3 three-gluon correlations agrees with the data.
