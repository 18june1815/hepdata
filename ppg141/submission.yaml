  We report on the first measurement of double-spin asymmetry, $A_{LL}$, of electrons from the decays of hadrons containing heavy flavor in longitudinally polarized $p$+$p$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 200 GeV for $p_T$ = 0.5 to 3.0 GeV/$c$. The asymmetry was measured at mid-rapidity ($|\eta|$ < 0.35) with the PHENIX detector at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider. The measured asymmetries are consistent with zero within the statistical errors. We obtained a constraint for the polarized gluon distribution in the proton of $|\Delta g/g(log_{10}x = -1.6^{+0.5}_{-0.4}, \mu = m_T^c)|^2$ < 0.033 (1 $\sigma$), based on a leading-order perturbative-quantum-chromodynamics model, using the measured asymmetry.
