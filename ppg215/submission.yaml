  We report on the nuclear dependence of transverse single-spin asymmetries (TSSAs) in the production of positively-charged hadrons in polarized $p^{\uparrow}$+$p$, $p^{\uparrow}$+Al and $p^{\uparrow}$+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV. The measurements have been performed at forward rapidity (1.4 < $\eta$ < 2.4) over the range of transverse momentum (1.8 < $p_T$ < 7.0 GeV/$c$) and Feynman-$x$ (0.1 < $x_F$< 0.2). We observed a positive asymmetry $A_N$ for positively-charged hadrons in $p^{\uparrow}$+$p$ collisions, and a significantly reduced asymmetry in $p^{\uparrow}$+$A$ collisions. These results reveal a nuclear dependence of charged hadron $A_N$ in a regime where perturbative techniques are relevant. These results provide new opportunities to use $p^{\uparrow}$+$A$ collisions as a tool to investigate the rich phenomena behind TSSAs in hadronic collisions and to use TSSA as a new handle in studying small-system collisions.
