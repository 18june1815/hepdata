  The PHENIX collaboration has measured jet cross-section and jet substructure in $p$+$p$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 200 GeV. Jets are reconstructed from charged particle tracks and electromagnetic calorimeter clusters using the anti-$k_t$ algorithm with a jet radius $R$ = 0.3, for jets with transverse momentum within 8.0 < $p_T$ < 40.0 GeV and pseudorapidity $|\eta|$ < 0.15. Cross-section, as well as distributions of soft-drop momentum fraction $z_g$, charged particle transverse momentum with respect to jet axis $j_T$, radial distribution of charged particles within jet $R$, and the distribution of $\xi$ = $-ln(z)$, where $z$ is the fraction of the jet momentum carried by the charged particle were measured. The measurements are compared to theoretical NLO and NNLO calculations, tuned PYTHIA, and to other existing experimental results.
