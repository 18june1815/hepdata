  BNL-RHIC. The PHENIX experiment has studied nuclear effects in p+Al and p+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}=200~{\rm GeV}$ on charged hadron production at forward rapidity ($1.4<\eta<2.4$, p-going direction) and backward rapidity ($-2.2<\eta<-1.4$, A-going direction). Such effects are quantified by measuring nuclear modification factors as a function of transverse momentum and pesudorapidity in various collision multiplicity selections. In central p+Al and p+Au collisions, a suppression (enhancement) is observed at forward (backward) rapidity compared to the binary scaled yields in p+p collisions. The magnitude of enhancement at backward rapidity is larger in p+Au collisions than in p+Al collisions, which have a smaller number of participating nucleons. However, the results at forward rapidity show a similar suppression within uncertainties. The results in the integrated centrality are compared with calculations using nuclear parton distribution functions, which show a reasonable agreement at the forward rapidity but fail to describe the backward rapidity enhancement.
