  The double helicity asymmetry in neutral pion production for $p_T$ = 1 to 12 GeV/$c$ has been measured with the PHENIX experiment in order to access the gluon spin contribution, $\Delta$$G$, to the proton spin. Measured asymmetries are consistent with zero, and at a theory scale of $\mu^2$ = 4 GeV$^2$ give $\Delta$$G^{[0.02,0.3]}$ = 0.1 to 0.2, with a constraint of -0.7 < $\Delta$$G^{[0.02,0.3]}$ < 0.5 at $\Delta\chi^2$ = 9 ($~3\sigma$) for our sampled gluon momentum fraction ($x$) range, 0.02 to 0.3. The results are obtained using predictions for our measured asymmetries generated from four representative fits to polarized deep inelastic scattering data. We also consider the dependence of the $\Delta$$G$ constraint on the choice of theoretical scale, a dominant uncertainty in these predictions.
