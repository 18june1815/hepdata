    Bose-Einstein correlations of identically ch√arged pion pairs were measured by the PHENIX experiment at mid-rapidity in Au + Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV. The Bertsch-Pratt radius parameters were determined as a function of the transverse momentum of the pair and as a function of the centrality of the collision. Using the full Coulomb correction, the ratio $R_{out}$/$R_{side}$ is smaller than unity for $⟨k_T⟩$ from 0.25 to 1.2 GeV/$c$ and for all measured centralities. However, using recently developed partial Coulomb correction methods, we find that $R_{out}$/$R_{side}$ is 0.8-1.1 for the measured $⟨k_T⟩$ range, and approximately constant at unity with the number of participants.
