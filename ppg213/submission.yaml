  PHENIX reports differential cross sections of $\mu\mu$ pairs from semileptonic heavy-flavor decays and the Drell-Yan production mechanism measured in $p+p$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 200 GeV at forward and backward rapidity (1.2 < |$\eta$| < 2.2). The $\mu\mu$ pairs from $c\bar{c}$, $b\bar{b}$, and Drell-Yan are separated using a template fit to unlike- and like-sign muon pair spectra in mass and $p_{T}$ . The azimuthal opening angle correlation between the muons from $c\bar{c}$ and $b\bar{b}$ decays and the pair-$p_{T}$ distributions are compared to distributions generated using pythia and powheg models, which both include next-to-leading order processes. The measured distributions for pairs from $c\bar{c}$ are consistent with pythia calculations. The $c\bar{c}$ data presents narrower azimuthal correlations and softer $p_{T}$ distributions compared to distributions generated from powheg. The $b\bar{b}$ data are well described by both models. The extrapolated total cross section for bottom production is 3.75$\pm$0.24(stat)$\pm$$^{0.35}_{0.50}$(syst)$\pm$0.45(global)[$\mu$b], which is consistent with previous measurements at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider in the same system at the same collision energy, and is approximately a factor of two higher than the central value calculated with theoretical models. The measured Drell-Yan cross section is in good agreement with next-to-leading-order quantum-chromodynamics calculations.

The systematic uncertainty type is indicated in the second column and is applicable only to the differential measurements. The uncertainties for the differential measurements vary with azimuthal opening angle, pair $p_{T}$ , or mass. Asymmetric uncertainties are quoted in bracketed values. For the $c\bar{c}$ measurement, the regions $\Delta\phi$ < $\pi$/2, $p_{T}$ < 0.5 GeV/$c$ and $p_{T}$ > 2.0 GeV/$c$ are excluded because the yield approaches zero and relative systematic uncertainties diverge. With these regions excluded, the difference between the systematic uncertainties of all measurements for the south and north muon arms differs by no greater than 2% for all systematic uncertainties sources.'
