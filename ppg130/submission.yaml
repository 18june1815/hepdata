  We report $e^{\pm}$âˆ’$\mu^{\pm}$ pair yield from charm decay measured between midrapidity electrons ($|\eta|$ < 0.35 and $p_T$ > 0.5 GeV/$c$) and forward rapidity muons (1.4 < $\eta$ < 2.1 and $p_T$ > 1.0 GeV/$c$) as a function of $\Delta\phi$ in both $p$+$p$ and in $d$+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV. Comparing the $p$+$p$ results with several different models, we find the results are consistent with a total charm cross section $\sigma_{c\bar{c}}$ = 538 $\pm$ 46 (stat) $\pm$ 197 (data syst) $\pm$ 174 (model syst) $\mu$b. These generators also indicate that the back-to-back peak at $\Delta\phi$ = $\pi$ is dominantly from the leading order contributions (gluon fusion), while higher order processes (flavor excitation and gluon splitting) contribute to the yield at all $\Delta\phi$. We observe a suppression in the pair yield per collision in $d$+Au. We find the pair yield suppression factor for 2.7 < $\Delta\phi$ < 3.2 rad is $J_{dA}$ = 0.433 $\pm$ 0.087 (stat) $\pm$ 0.135 (syst), indicating cold nuclear matter modification of $c\bar{c}$ pairs.
