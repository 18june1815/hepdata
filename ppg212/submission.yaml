  BNL-RHIC. The PHENIX collaboration presents first measurements of low-momentum (0.4< $p_T$ <3 GeV/$c$) direct-photon yields from Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=39 and 62.4 GeV. For both beam energies the direct-photon yields are substantially enhanced with respect to expectations from prompt processes, similar to the yields observed in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=200. Analyzing the photon yield as a function of the experimental observable $dN_{ch}/d\eta$ reveals that the low-momentum (>1 GeV/$c$) direct-photon yield $dN^{dir}_{\gamma}/d\eta$ is a smooth function of $dN_{ch}/d\eta$ and can be well described as proportional to $(dN_{ch}/d\eta)^\alpha$ with $\alpha\approx1.25$. This scaling behavior holds for a wide range of beam energies at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider and the Large Hadron Collider, for centrality selected samples, as well as for different, A+A collision systems. At a given beam energy the scaling also holds for high $p_T$(>5 GeV/$c$) but when results from different collision energies are compared, an additional $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$-dependent multiplicative factor is needed to describe the integrated-direct-photon yield.
