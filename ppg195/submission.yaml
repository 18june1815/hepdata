  Dihadron and isolated direct photon-hadron angular correlations are measured in $p$+$p$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 510 GeV. Correlations of charged hadrons of 0.7 < $p_T$ < 10 GeV/$c$ with $\pi^0$ mesons of 4 < $p_T$ < 15 GeV/$c$ or isolated direct photons of 7 < $p_T$ < 15 GeV/$c$ are used to study nonperturbative effects generated by initial-state partonic transverse momentum and final-state transverse momentum from fragmentation. The nonperturbative behavior is characterized by measuring the out-of-plane transverse momentum component $p_{out}$ perpendicular to the axis of the trigger particle, which is the high-$p_T$ direct photon or $\pi^0$. Nonperturbative evolution effects are extracted from Gaussian fits to the away-side inclusive-charged-hadron yields for different trigger-particle transverse momenta ($p^{trig}_T$). The Gaussian widths and root mean square of $p_{out}$ are reported as a function of the interaction hard scale $p^{trig}_T$ to investigate possible transverse-momentum-dependent evolution differences between the $\pi^0$-h$^\pm$ and direct photon-h$^\pm$ correlations and factorization breaking effects. The widths are found to decrease with $p^{trig}_T$, which indicates that the Collins-Soper-Sterman soft factor is not driving the evolution with the hard scale in nearly back-to-back dihadron and direct photonhadron production in $p$+$p$ collisions. This behavior is in contrast to Drell-Yan and semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering measurements.
