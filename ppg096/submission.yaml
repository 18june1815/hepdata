  The PHENIX experiment at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) has performed systematic measurements of $\phi$ meson production in the $K^+K^-$ decay channel at midrapidity in $p$+$p$, $d$+Au, Cu+Cu and Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV. Results are presented on the $\phi$ invariant yield and the nuclear modification factor $R_{AA}$ for Au+Au and Cu+Cu, and $R_{dA}$ for $d$+Au collisions, studied as a function of transverse momentum (1 < $p_T$ < 7 GeV/$c$) and centrality. In central and mid-central Au+Au collisions, the $R_{AA}$ of $\phi$ exhibits a suppression relative to expectations from binary scaled $p$+$p$ results. The amount of suppression is smaller than that of the neutral pion and the $\eta$ meson in the intermediate $p_T$ range (2-5 GeV/$c$); whereas at higher $p_T$ the $\phi$, $\pi^0$, and $\eta$ show similar suppression. The baryon (protons and anti-protons) excess observed in central Au+Au collisions at intermediate $p_T$ is not observed for the $\phi$ meson despite the similar mass of the proton and the $\phi$. This suggests that the excess is linked to the number of constituent quarks rather than the hadron mass. The difference gradually disappears with decreasing centrality and for peripheral collisions the $R_{AA}$ values for both particles are consistent with binary scaling. Cu+Cu collisions show the same yield and suppression as Au+Au collisions for the same number of $N_{part}$. The $R_{dA}$ of $\phi$ shows no evidence for cold nuclear effects within uncertainties.
