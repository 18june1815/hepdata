  Measurements of the anisotropy parameter $v_2$ of identified hadrons (pions, kaons, and protons) as a function of centrality, transverse momentum $p_T$ , and transverse kinetic energy KE$_T$ at midrapidity (|$\eta$| < 0.35) in Au + Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ =200 GeV are presented. Pions and protons are identified up to $p_T$ = 6 GeV/c, and kaons up to $p_T$ = 4 GeV/c, by combining information from time-of-flight and aerogel Cerenkov detectors in the PHENIX ˇExperiment. The scaling of $v_2$ with the number of valence quarks ($n_q$) has been studied in different centrality bins as a function of transverse momentum and transverse kinetic energy. A deviation from previously observed quark-number scaling is observed at large values of KE$_T$ /$n_q$ in noncentral Au + Au collisions (20–60%), but this scaling remains valid in central collisions (0–10%).
