  We report a measurement of $e^+e^−$ pairs from semileptonic heavy-flavor decays in $p$+$p$ collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV. The $e^+e^−$ pair yield from $b\bar{b}$ and $c\bar{c}$ is separated by exploiting a double differential fit done simultaneously in dielectron invariant mass and $p_T$. We used three different event generators, PYTHIA, MC@ALO, and POWHEG, to simulate the $e^+e^−$ spectra from $c\bar{c}$ and $b\bar{b}$ production. The data can be well described by all three generators within the detector acceptance. However, when using the generators to extrapolate to 4$\pi$, significant differences are observed for the total cross section. These difference are less pronounced for $b\bar{b}$ than for $c\bar{c}$. The same model dependence was observed in already published $d$+$A$ data. The $p$+$p$ data are also directly compared with $d$+$A$ data in mass and $p_T$, and within the statistical accuracy no nuclear modification is seen.
