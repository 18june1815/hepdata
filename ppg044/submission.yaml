  The dependence of transverse momentum spectra of neutral pions and $\eta$ mesons with $p_T$ < 16 GeV/$c$ and $p_T$ < 12 GeV/$c$, respectively, on the centrality of the collision has been measured at mid-rapidity by the PHENIX experiment at RHIC in $d$+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV. The measured yields are compared to those in $p$+$p$ collisions at the same $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ scaled by the number of underlying nucleon-nucleon collisions in $d$+Au. At all centralities the yield ratios show no suppression, in contrast to the strong suppression seen for central Au+Au collisions at RHIC. Only a weak $p_T$ and centrality dependence can be observed.
