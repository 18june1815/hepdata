    The transverse single-spin asymmetries of neutral pions and non-identified charged hadrons have been measured at mid-rapidity in polarized proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 200 GeV. The data cover a transverse momentum $(p_T)$ range 0.5-5.0 GeV/$c$ for charged hadrons and 1.0-5.0 GeV/$c$ for neutral pions, at a Feynman-$x$ $(x_F)$ value of approximately zero. The asymmetries seen in this previously unexplored kinematic region are consistent with zero within statistical errors of a few percent. In addition, the inclusive charged hadron cross section at mid-rapidity from 0.5 < $p_T$ < 7.0 GeV/$c$ is presented and compared to NLO pQCD calculations. Successful description of the unpolarized cross section above ~2 GeV/$c$ using NLO pQCD suggests that pQCD is applicable in the interpretation of the asymmetry results in the relevant kinematic range.
