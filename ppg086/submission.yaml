  The production of low mass $e^+e^-$ pairs for $m_{e^+e^-}$ < 300 MeV/$c^2$ and 1 < $p_T$ <5 GeV/$c$ is measured in $p$+$p$ and Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV. Enhanced yield above hadronic sources is observed. Treating the excess as internal conversions, the invariant yield of direct photons is deduced. In central Au+Au collisions, the excess of direct photon yield over $p$+$p$ is exponential in transverse momentum, with inverse slope $T$ = 221 $\pm$ 19 (stat) $\pm$ 19 (syst) MeV. Hydrodynamical models with initial temperatures ranging from $T_{int}$ ~300-600 MeV at times of ~ 0.6 - 0.15 fm/$c$ after the collision are in qualitative agreement with the data. Lattice QCD predicts a phase transition to quark gluon plasma at ~ 170 MeV.
