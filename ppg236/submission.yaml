comment: 'Recently, the PHENIX Collaboration has published second- and
third-harmonic Fourier coefficients $v_2$ and $v_3$ for midrapidity
($|\eta|<0.35$) charged hadrons in 0\%--5\% central $p$$+$Au, $d$$+$Au,
and $^3$He$+$Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}=200$ GeV utilizing three
sets of two-particle correlations for two detector combinations with
different pseudorapidity acceptance [Phys. Rev. C {\bf 105}, 024901
(2022)]. This paper extends these measurements of $v_2$ to all
centralities in $p$$+$Au, $d$$+$Au, and $^3$He$+$Au collisions, as well
as $p$$+$$p$ collisions, as a function of transverse momentum ($p_T$)
and event multiplicity. The kinematic dependence of $v_2$ is quantified
as the ratio $R$ of $v_2$ between the two detector combinations as a
function of event multiplicity for $0.5$$<$$p_T$$<$$1$ and
$2$$<$$p_T$$<$$2.5$ GeV/$c$. A multiphase-transport (AMPT) model
can reproduce the observed $v_2$ in most-central to midcentral $d$$+$Au
and $^3$He$+$Au collisions.  However, the AMPT model
systematically overestimates the measurements in $p$$+$$p$, $p$$+$Au,
and peripheral $d$$+$Au and $^3$He$+$Au collisions, indicating a higher
nonflow contribution in AMPT than in the experimental data.  The
AMPT model fails to describe the observed $R$ for
$0.5$$<$$p_T$$<$$1$ GeV/$c$, but there is qualitative agreement with the
measurements for $2$$<$$p_T$$<$$2.5$ GeV/$c$.'
