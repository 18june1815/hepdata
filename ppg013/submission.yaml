    PHENIX has measured the centrality dependence of charged hadron $p_T$ spectra from Au + Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 130 GeV. The truncated mean $p_T$ decreases with centrality for $p_T$ $>$ 2 GeV/$c$, indicating an apparent reduction of the contribution from hard scattering to high $p_T$ hadron production. For central collisions the yield at high $p_T$ is shown to be suppressed compared to binary nucleon-nucleon collision scaling of p+p data. This suppression is monotonically increasing with centrality, but most of the change occurs below 30% centrality, i.e. for collisions with less than $~$ 140 participating nucleons. The observed $p_T$ and centrality dependence is consistent with the particle production predicted by models including hard scattering and subsequent energy loss of the scattered partons in the dense matter created in the collisions.

# This is Figure 6.

location: Data From Fig. 6 of Phys. Lett. B 561 (2003) 82-92
description: 'The top panel gives the nuclear modification factor $R_{AA}$ for three exclusive $p_T$ regions as a function of the centrality of the collision. The lower panel shows essentially the same quantity but normalized to the number of participant pairs rather than to the number of binary collisions. The dotted line indicates the expectation for scaling with the number of binary collisions (top) or with the number of participants (bottom). Only statistical errors are shown. The systematic error on the scale and the centrality dependence are identical to the errors shown in Fig. 5. These errors are correlated, i.e. take their maximum or minimum value simultaneously for all centrality and $p_T$ selections. In addition, there are also $p_T$ dependent systematic errors, which are given in Table 1. The systematic errors do not alter the trends in the data.'
