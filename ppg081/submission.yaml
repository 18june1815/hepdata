  BNL-RHIC. We present the first measurement of photoproduction of $J/\psi$ and of two-photon production of high-mass $e^+e^-$--pairs in electromagnetic (or ultra-peripheral) nucleus-nucleus interactions, using Au+Au data at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV. The events are tagged with forward neutrons emitted following Coulomb excitation of one or both $Au^\star$ nuclei. The event sample consists of 28 events with $m_{e^+e^-}>$ 2 GeV/$c^2$ with zero like-sign background. The measured cross sections at midrapidity of $d \sigma/dy \, (J/\psi + Xn, y=0) =$ 76 $\pm$ 33 (stat) $\pm$ 11 (syst) $\mu$b and $d^2 \sigma/dm dy \, (e^+e^- + Xn, y=0) =$ 86 $\pm$ 23 (stat) $\pm$ 16 (syst) $\mu$b/(GeV/c$^2$) for $m_{e^+e^-} \in \mbox{[2.0,2.8]}$ GeV/c$^2$ are consistent with various theoretical predictions.
