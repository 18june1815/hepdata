  BNL-RHIC.  The PHENIX experiment at RHIC has measured charged hadron yields at mid-rapidity over a wide range of transverse momentum (0.5 < $p_T$ < 10 GeV/$c$) in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$= 200 GeV. The data are compared to $\pi^0$ measurements from the same experiment. For both charged hadrons and neutral pions, the yields per nucleon-nucleon collision are significantly suppressed in central compared to peripheral and nucleon-nucleon collisions. The suppression sets in gradually and increases with increasing centrality of the collisions. Above 4-5 GeV/$c$ in $p_T$, a constant and almost identical suppression of charged hadrons and $\pi^0$ s is observed. The $p_T$ spectra are compared to published spectra from Au+Au at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$= 130 GeV in terms of $x_T$ scaling. Central and peripheral $\pi^0$ as well as peripheral charged spectra exhibit the same $x_T$ scaling as observed in p+p data.
