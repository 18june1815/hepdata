comment: | # Information that applies to all data tables.
  New measurements are presented for charged hadron azimuthal correlations at mid-rapidity in Au+Au collissions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 62.4 and 200 GeV. They are compared to earlier measurements obtained at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 130 GeV and in Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 17.2 GeV. Sizeable anisotropies are observed with centrality and transverse momentum ($p_T$) dependence characteristic of elliptic flow ($v_2$). For a broad range of centralities, the observed magnitudes and trends of the differential anisotropy, $v_2$($p_T$), change very little over the collision energy range $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 62-200 GeV, indicating saturation of the excitation function for $v_2$ at these energies. Sucha a saturation may be indicative of the dominance of a very soft equation of state for $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ ~ 60-200 GeV.

description: Assorted-$p_T$ correlation functions (0.65 < $p_{T,ref}$ < 2.5 GeV/$c$) for charged hadrons of 0.5 < $p_T$ < 0.7 GeV/$c$ and 1.0 < $p_T$ < 1.5 obtained in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{S_{NN}}$ = 62.4 GeV. The left and right panels show correlation functions for centrality cuts of 20-40% and 40-60% respectively. The lines represent fits to the correlation functions.
