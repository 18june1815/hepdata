  The PHENIX experiment at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider has measured $\omega$ meson production via leptonic and hadronic decay channels in $p$ + $p$, $d$+Au, Cu+Cu, and Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{S_{NN}}$=200 GeV. The invariant transverse momentum spectra measured in different decay modes give consistent results. Measurements in the hadronic decay channel in Cu+Cu and Au+Au collisions show that $\omega$ production has a suppression pattern at high transverse momentum, similar to that of ${\pi}^{0}$ and ${\eta}$ in central collisions, but no suppression is observed in peripheral collisions. The nuclear modification factors, $R_{AA}$, are consistent in Cu+Cu and Au+Au collisions at similar numbers of participant nucleons.
