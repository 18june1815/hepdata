  Azimuthal angle ($\Delta\phi$) correlations are presented for charged hadrons from dijets for 0.4 < $p_T$ < 10 GeV/$c$ in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV. With increasing $p_T$, the away-side distribution evolves from a broad to a concave shape, then to a convex shape. Comparisons to $p$+$p$ data suggest that the away-side can be divided into a partially suppressed "head" region centered at $\Delta\phi$ ~ $\pi$, and an enhanced "shoulder" region centered at $\Delta\phi$ ~ $\pi$ +/- 1.1. The $p_T$ spectrum for the "head" region softens toward central collisions, consistent with the onset of jet quenching. The spectral slope for the "shoulder" region is independent of centrality and trigger $p_T$, which offers constraints on energy transport mechanisms and suggests that the "shoulder" region contains the medium response to energetic jets.
