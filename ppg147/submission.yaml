comment: 'Measurements of the anisotropic flow coefficients
$v_2\{\Psi_2\}$, $v_3\{\Psi_3\}$, $v_4\{\Psi_4\}$, and
$v_4\{\Psi_2\}$ for identified particles ($\pi^{\pm}$, $K^{\pm}$,
and $p+\bar{p}$) at midrapidity, obtained relative to the event
planes $\Psi_m$ at forward rapidities in Au$+$Au collisions at
$\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}$~=~200 GeV, are presented as a function of
collision centrality and particle transverse momenta $p_T$. The
$v_n$ coefficients show characteristic patterns consistent with
hydrodynamical expansion of the matter produced in the
collisions.  For each harmonic $n$, a modified valence quark
number $N_q$ scaling (plotting $v_n\{\Psi_m\}/(N_q)^{n/2}$ versus
${\rm KE}_T/N_q$) is observed to yield a single curve for all the
measured particle species for a broad range of transverse kinetic
energies ${\rm KE}_T$. A simultaneous blast-wave model fit to the
observed $v_n\{\Psi_m\}(p_T)$ coefficients and published particle spectra
identifies radial flow anisotropies $\rho_n\{\Psi_m\}$ and spatial
eccentricities $s_n\{\Psi_m\}$ at freeze-out.  These are generally smaller
than the initial-state participant-plane (PP) geometric eccentricities
$\varepsilon_n\{\Psi_m^{\rm PP}\}$,
as also observed in the final eccentricity from quantum
interferometry measurements with respect to the event plane.'
