  Measurement of the $\Lambda$ and $\bar{\Lambda}$ particles in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 130 GeV.
  We present results on the measurement of $\Lambda$ and $\bar{\Lambda}$ production in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 130 GeV with the PHENIX detector at RHIC. The transverse momentum spectra were measured for minimum bias and for the $5\%$ most central events. The $\bar{\Lambda}$/$\Lambda$ ratios are constant as a function of $p_T$ and the number of participants. The measured net lambda density is significantly larger than predicted by models based on hadronic strings (e.g. HIJING) but in approximate agreement with models which include the gluon junction mechanism.
