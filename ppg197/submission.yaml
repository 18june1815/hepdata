   We report the first measurement of the fraction of $J/\psi$ mesons coming from $B$-meson decay ($F_{B \rightarrow J/\psi}$) in $p$+$p$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 510 GeV. The measurement is performed using the forward silicon vertex detector and central vertex detector at PHENIX, which provide precise tracking and distance-of-closest-approach determinations, enabling the statistical separation of $J/\psi$ due to $B$-meson decays from prompt $J/\psi$. The measured value of $F_{B \rightarrow = J/\psi}$ is $8.1\%\pm2.3\% (stat)\pm1.9\% (syst)$ for $J/\psi$ with transverse momenta 0 < $p_T$ < 5 GeV/$c$ and rapidity 1.2 < $|y|$ < 2.2. The measured fraction $F_{B \rightarrow J/\psi}$ at PHENIX is compared to values measured by other experiments at higher center of mass energies and to fixed-order-next-to-leading-logarithm and color-evaporation-model predictions. The $b\bar{b}$ cross section per unit rapidity ($d\sigma/dy(pp→b\bar{b})$) extracted from the obtained $F_{B \rightarrow J/\psi}$ and the PHENIX inclusive $J/\psi$ cross section measured at 200 GeV scaled with color-evaporation-model calculations, at the mean $B$ hadron rapidity $y = \pm1.7$ in 510 GeV $p$+$p$ collisions, is $3.63^{+1.92}_{−1.70}$ $\mu$$b$, and it is consistent with the fixed-order-next-to-leading-logarithm calculations.
