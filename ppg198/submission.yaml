  We report the first measurement of the full angular distribution for inclusive $J/\psi$ $\rightarrow$ $\mu^+\mu^-$ decays in $p$+$p$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 510 GeV. The measurements are made for $J/\psi$ transverse momentum 2 < $p_T$ < 10 GeV/$c$ and rapidity 1.2 < $y$ < 2.2 in the Helicity, Collins-Soper, and Gottfried-Jackson reference frames. In all frames the polar coefficient $\lambda_{\theta}$ is strongly negative at low $p_T$ and becomes close to zero at high $p_T$, while the azimuthal coefficient $\lambda_{\phi}$ is close to zero at low $p_T$, and becomes slightly negative at higher $p_T$. The frame-independent coefficient $\bar{\lambda}$ is strongly negative at all $p_T$ in all frames. The data are compared to the theoretical predictions provided by nonrelativistic quantum chromodynamics models.
