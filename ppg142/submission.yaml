  The three $\Upsilon$ states, $\Upsilon$(1$S$+2$S$+3$S$), are measured in $d$+Au and $p$+$p$ collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV and rapidities 1.2 < $|y|$ < 2.2 by the PHENIX experiment at the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider. Cross sections for the inclusive $\Upsilon$(1$S$+2$S$+3$S$) production are obtained. The inclusive yields per binary collision for $d$+Au collisions relative to those in $p$+$p$ collisions ($R_{dAu}$) are found to be 0.62 $\pm$ 0.26 (stat) $\pm$ 0.13 (syst) in the gold-going direction and 0.91 $\pm$ 0.33 (stat) $\pm$ 0.16 (syst) in the deuteron-going direction. The measured results are compared to a nuclear-shadowing model, EPS09 [JHEP 04, 065 (2009)], combined with a final-state breakup cross section, $\sigma_{br}$, and compared to lower energy $p$+$A$ results. We also compare the results to the PHENIX $J/\psi$ results [Phys. Rev. Lett. 107, 142301 (2011)]. The rapidity dependence of the observed $\Upsilon$ suppression is consistent with lower energy $p$+$A$ measurements.
