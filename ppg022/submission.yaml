  Elliptic Flow of Identified Hadrons in Au+Au Collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV
  The anisotropy paramenter ($v_2$), the second harmonic of the azimuthal particles distributions, has been measured with the PHENIX detector in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV for identified and inclusive charged particle production at central rapidities (|$\eta$| = 3-4). We observe that the $v_2$ of mesons falls below that of (anti)baryons for $p_T$ > 2 GeV/$c$, in marked contrast to the predictions of a hydrodynamical model. A quard coalescence model is also investigated.
