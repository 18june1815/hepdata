  We present measurements of $e^+e^âˆ’$ production at midrapidity in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV. The invariant yield is studied within the PHENIX detector acceptance over a wide range of mass ($m_{ee}$ < 5 GeV/$c^2$) and pair transverse momentum ($p_T$ < 5 GeV/$c$), for minimum bias and for five centrality classes. The $e^+e^-$ yield is compared to the expectations from known sources. In the low-mass region ($m_{ee}$ = 0.30 - 0.76 GeV/$c^2$) there is an enhancement that increases with centrality and is distributed over the entire pair $p_T$ range measured. It is significantly smaller than previously reported by the PHENIX experiment and amounts to 2.3 $\pm$ 0.4(stat) $\pm$ 0.4(syst) $\pm$ 0.2$^{model}$ or to 1.7 $\pm$ 0.3(stat) $\pm$ 0.3(syst) $\pm$ 0.2$^{model}$ for minimum bias collisions when the open-heavy-flavor contribution is calculated with PYTHIA or MC@NLO, respectively. The inclusive mass and $p_T$ distributions as well as the centrality dependence are well reproduced by model calculations where the enhancement mainly originates from the melting of the $\rho$ meson resonance as the system approaches chiral symmetry restoration. In the intermediate-mass region ($m_{ee}$ = 1.2 - 2.8 GeV/$c^2$), the data hint at a significant contribution in addition to the yield from the semileptonic decays of heavy-flavor mesons.
