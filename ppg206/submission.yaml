  BNL-RHIC. Recently, multiparticle-correlation measurements of relativistic $p/d/^3$He+Au, $p$+Pb, and even $p+p$ collisions have shown surprising collective signatures. Here we present beam-energy-scan measurements of 2-, 4-, and 6-particle angular correlations in $d$+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200, 62.4, 39, and 19.6 GeV. We also present measurements of 2- and 4-particle angular correlations in $p$+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV. We find the 4-particle cumulant to be real-valued for d+Au collisions at all four energies. We also find that the 4-particle cumulant in $p$+Au has the opposite sign as that in $d$+Au. Further we find that the 6-particle cumulant agrees with the 4-particle cumulant in $d$+Au collisions at 200 GeV, indicating that nonflow effects are subdominant. These observations provide strong evidence that the correlations originate from the initial geometric configuration which is then translated into the momentum distribution for all particles, commonly referred to as collectivity.
