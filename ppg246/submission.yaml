  BNL-RHIC. The PHENIX collaboration has measured the transverse single-spin asymmetry (TSSA) for electrons and positrons from heavy flavor hadron decays in $p^{\uparrow} + p$ collisions in the pseudorapidity range $|\eta|<0.35$ and at center-of-mass energy 200 GeV using data taken in 2015. Midrapidity open heavy flavor hadron production at $\sqrt{s} = 200$ GeV proceeds primarily through the $gg \rightarrow Q\bar{Q}$ channel, providing sensitivity to constrain initial-state spin-momentum correlations of gluons in transversely polarized protons. These asymmetries are extracted as a function of transverse momentum for electrons and positrons separately, allowing for constraints to be placed on the twist-3 trigluon correlation functions, which are related to the Sivers transverse-momentum-dependent parton distribution function (PDF) for gluons.

description: Data from Figure 1 of open heavy flavor $e^{\pm}$ single spin asymmetries in transversely polarized p+p collisions as a function of $p_{T}$. An additional scale uncertainty of 3.4% due to the polarization uncertainty is not shown.
