    Dihadron correlations at high transverse momentum in $d$+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV at midrapidity are measured by the PHENIX experiment at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). From these correlations we extract several structural characteristics of jets; the root-mean-squared (RMS) transverse momentum of fragmenting hadrons with respect to the jet $\sqrt{<j_T^2>}$, the mean sine-squared angle between the scattered partons $<sin^2(\phi_{jj})>$, and the number of particles produced within the dijet that are associated with a high-$p_T$ particle ($dN/dx_E$ distributions). We observe that the fragmentation characteristics of jets in $d$+Au collisions are very similar to those in $p$+$p$ collisions and that there is also little dependence on the centrality of the $d$+Au collision. This is consistent with the nuclear medium having little influence on the fragmentation process. Furthermore, there is no statistically significant increase in the value of $<sin^2(\phi_{jj})>$ from $p$+$p$ to $d$+Au collisions. This constrains the amount of multiple scattering that partons undergo in the cold nuclear medium before and after a hard-collision.
