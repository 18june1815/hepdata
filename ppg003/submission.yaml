comment: |
  BNL-RHIC. Transverse momentum spectra for charged hadrons and for neutral pions in the range 1~GeV/c~$< p_T <$~5~GeV/c have been measured by the PHENIX experiment at RHIC in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}=130$~GeV. At high $p_T$ the spectra from peripheral nuclear collisions are consistent with scaling the spectra from p+p collisions by the average number of binary nucleon-nucleon collisions.  The spectra from central collisions are significantly suppressed when compared to the binary-scaled p+p expectation, and also when compared to similarly binary-scaled peripheral collisions, indicating a novel nuclear medium effect in central nuclear collisions at RHIC energies.
