  Bose-Einstein correlations of charged kaons are measured for Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV and are compared to charged pion probes, which have a larger hadronic scattering cross section. Three dimensional Gaussian source radii are extracted, along with a one-dimensional kaon emission source function. The centrality dependences of the three Gaussian radii are well described by a single linear function if $N_{part}^{1/3}$ with zero intercept. Imaging analysis shows a deviation from a Gaussian tail at $r \ge$ 10 fm, although the bulk emission at lower radius is well-described by a Gaussian. The presence of a non-Gaussian tail in the kaon source reaffirms that the particle emission region in a heavy ion collision is extended, and that similar measurements with pions are not solely due to the decay of long-lived resonances.
