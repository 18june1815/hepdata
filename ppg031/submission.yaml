    We present a measurement of the double longitudinal spin asymmetry in inclusive $\pi^0$ production in polarized proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 200 GeV. The data were taken at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider with average beam polarizations of 27%. The measurements are the first of a porgram to study the longitudinal spin structure of the proton, using strongly interacting probes, at collider energies. The asymmetry is presented for transverse momenta 1-5 GeV/$c$ at mid-rapidity, where next-to-leading order perturbative quantum chromodynamic (NLO pQCD) calculations well describe the unpolarized cross section. The observed asymmetry is small and is compared with a NLO pQCD calculation with a range of polarized gluon distributions.
