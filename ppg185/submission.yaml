  The PHENIX experiment at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider has measured $\phi$ meson production and its nuclear modification in asymmetric Cu+Au heavy-ion collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV at both forward Cu-going direction (1.2 < $y$ < 2.2) and backward Au-going direction (−2.2 < $y$ < −1.2), rapidities. The measurements are performed via the dimuon decay channel and reported as a function of the number of participating nucleons, rapidity, and transverse momentum. In the most central events, 0%–20% centrality, the $\phi$ meson yield integrated over 1 < $p_T$ < 5 GeV/$c$ prefers a smaller value, which means a larger nuclear modification, in the Cu-going direction compared to the Au-going direction. Additionally, the nuclear-modification factor in Cu+Au collisions averaged over all centrality is measured to be similar to the previous PHENIX result in $d$+Au collisions for these rapidities.
