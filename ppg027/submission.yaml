    Event-by-event fluctuations of the average transverse momentum of produced particles near mid-rapidity have been measured by the PHENIX Collaboration in $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV Au + Au and $p$ + $p$ collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider. The fluctuations are observed to be in excess of the expectation for statistically independent particle emission for all centralities. The excess fluctuations exhibit a dependence on both the centrality of the collision and on the transverse momentum window over which the average is calculated. Both the centrality and $p_T$ dependence can be well reproduced by a simulation of random particle production with the addition of contributions from hard scattering processes.
