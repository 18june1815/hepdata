  Cross sections for mid-rapidity production of direct photons in $p$+$p$ collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) are reported for 3 < $p_T$ < 16 GeV/$c$. Next-to-leading order (NLO) perturbative QCD (pQCD) describes the data well for $p_T$ > 5 GeV/$c$, where the uncertainties of the measurement and theory are comparable. We also report on the effect of requiring the photons to be isolated from parton jet energy. The observed fraction of isolated photons is well described by pQCD for $p_T$ > 7 GeV/$c$.
