  Deuteron and antideuteron production in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV
  The production of deuterons and antideuterons in the transverse momentum range 1.1 < $p_T$ < GeV/$c$ at mid-rapidity in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV has been studied by the PHENIX experiment at RHIC. A coalescence analysis comparing the deuteron and antideuteron spectra with those of protons and antiprotons, has been performed. The coalescence probability is equal for both deuterons and antideuterons and increases as a function of $p_T$, which is consistent with an expanding collision zone. Comparing (anti)proton yields $\bar{p}$/$p$ = 0.73 $\pm$ 0.01, with (anti)deuteron yields: $\bar{d}$/$d$ = 0.47 $\pm$ 0.03, we estimate that $\bar{n}$/n = 0.64 $\pm$ 0.04.
