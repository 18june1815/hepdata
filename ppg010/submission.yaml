    Two-pion correlations in $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ =130~GeV Au+Au collisions at RHIC have been measured over a broad range of pair transverse momentum $k_T$ by the PHENIX experiment at RHIC. The $k_T$~dependent transverse radii are similar to results from heavy ion collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 4.1, 4.9, and 17.3 GeV, whereas the longitudinal radius increases monotonically with beam energy. The ratio of the outwards to sidewards transverse radii ($R_{out}/R_{side}$) is consistent with unity and independent of $k_T$.
