  Event-by event fluctuations in Mean $p_T$ and mean $E_T$ in $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 130GeV Au+Au Collisions
  Distributions of event-by-event fluctuations of the mean transverse momentum and mean transverse energy near mid-rapidity have been measured in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 130 GeV at RHIC. By comparing the distributions to what is expected for statistically independent particle emission, the magnitude of non-statistical fluctuations in mean transverse momentum is determined to be consistent with zero. Also, no significant non-random fluctuations in mean transverse energy are observed. By constructing a fluctuation model with two event classes that preserve the mean and variance of the semi-inclusive $p_T$ or $e_T$ spectra, we exclude a region of fluctuations in $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 130 GeV Au+Au collisions.

description: The residual distribution between the data and mixed event $M_{e_T}$ spectra as a function of $M_{e_T}$ in units of standard deviation. The total ${\chi}^2$ and the number of degrees of freedom for the $0-5\%$, $0-10\%$, $10-20\%$, $20-30\%$ centrality classes are 310.0/32, 896.4/36, 678.7/47, and 553.9/53, respectively. A large fraction of the residual contributions are due to the effects of cluster merging.
