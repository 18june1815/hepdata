  Event-by event fluctuations in Mean $p_T$ and mean $E_T$ in $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 130GeV Au+Au Collisions
  Distributions of event-by-event fluctuations of the mean transverse momentum and mean transverse energy near mid-rapidity have been measured in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 130 GeV at RHIC. By comparing the distributions to what is expected for statistically independent particle emission, the magnitude of non-statistical fluctuations in mean transverse momentum is determined to be consistent with zero. Also, no significant non-random fluctuations in mean transverse energy are observed. By constructing a fluctuation model with two event classes that preserve the mean and variance of the semi-inclusive $p_T$ or $e_T$ spectra, we exclude a region of fluctuations in $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 130 GeV Au+Au collisions.
