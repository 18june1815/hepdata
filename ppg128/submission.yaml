  Back-to-back hadron pair yields in $d$+Au and $p$+$p$ collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV were measured with the PHENIX detector at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider. Rapidity separated hadron pairs were detected with the trigger hadron at pseudorapidity $|\eta|$ < 0.35 and the associated hadron at forward rapidity (deuteron direction, 3.0 < $\eta$ < 3.8). Pairs were also detected with both hadrons measured at forward rapidity; in this case the yield of back-to-back hadron pairs in $d$+Au collisions with small impact parameters is observed to be suppressed by a factor of 10 relative to $p$+$p$ collisions. The kinematics of these pairs is expected to probe partons in the Au nucleus with low fraction $x$ of the nucleon momenta, where the gluon densities rise sharply. The observed suppression as a function of nuclear thickness, $p_T$, and $\eta$ points to cold nuclear matter effects arising at high parton densities.
