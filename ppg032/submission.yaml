    Azimuthal correlations of high-$p_T$ charged hadron pairs from (di-)jet-fragmentation are studied at mid-rapidity in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV. The distribution of jet-associated partner hadrons (1.0 < $p_T$ < 2.5 GeV/$c$) per trigger hadron (2.5 < $p_T$ < 4.0 GeV/$c$) is found to vary with collision centrality, both in shape and in yield, indicating a significant effect of the nuclear collision medium on the (di-)jet fragmentation process.
