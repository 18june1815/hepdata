  The fraction of $J/\psi$ mesons which come from $B$-meson decay, F$_{B \rightarrow J/\psi}$, is measured for $J/\psi$ rapidity 1.2 < $|y|$ < 2.2 and $p_T$ > 0 in $p$+$p$ and Cu+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV with the PHENIX detector. The extracted fraction is F$_{B \rightarrow J/\psi}$ = 0.025 $\pm$ 0.006(stat) $\pm$ 0.010(syst) for $p$+$p$ collisions. For Cu+Au collisions, F$_{B \rightarrow J/\psi}$ is 0.094 $\pm$ 0.028(stat) $\pm$ 0.037(syst) in the Au-going direction (−2.2 < $y$ < −1.2) and 0.089 $\pm$ 0.026(stat) $\pm$ 0.040(syst) in the Cu-going direction (1.2 < $y$ < 2.2). The nuclear modification factor, $R_{CuAu}$, of $B$ mesons in Cu+Au collisions is consistent with binary scaling of measured yields in $p$+$p$ at both forward and backward rapidity.
