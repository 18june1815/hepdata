  Direct photons have been measured in $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV $d$+Au collisions at midrapidity. A wide $p_{T}$ range is covered by measurements of nearly-real virtual photons (1 < $p_{T}$ < 6 GeV/$c$) and real photons (5 < $p_{T}$ < 16 GeV/$c$). The invariant yield of the direct photons in $d$+Au collisions over the scaled $p+p$ cross section is consistent with unity. Theoretical calculations assuming standard cold-nuclear-matter effects describe the data well for the entire $p_{T}$ range. This indicates that the large enhancement of direct photons observed in Au+Au collisions for 1.0 < $p_{T}$ < 2.5 GeV/$c$ is due to a source other than the initial-state nuclear effects.
