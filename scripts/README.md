# HEPData helper scripts

A folder to keep various scripts facilitating submissions to the HEPData site

makethumbnails.pl is a perl script which will copy every png in a directory to thumb_FILENAME.png.  Thumbnail images must begin with "thumb_" so this script helps just copy existing files to what HEPData looks for.
