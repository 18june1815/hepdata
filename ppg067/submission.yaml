  We present azimuthal angle correlations of intermediate transverse momentum (1-4 GeV/$c$) hadrons from dijets in Cu+Cu and Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 62.4 and 200 GeV. The away-side dijet induced azimuthal correlation is broadened, non-Gaussian, and peaked away from $\Delta\phi$ = $\pi$ in central and semi-central collisions in all the systems. The broadening and peak location are found to depend upon the number of participants in the collision, but not on the collision energy or beam nuclei. These results are consistent with sound or shock wave models, but pose challenges to Cherenkov gluon radiation models.
