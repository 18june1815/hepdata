  Correlations between $p$ and $\bar{p}$ at transverse momenta typical of enhanced baryon production in Au+Au collisions are reported. The PHENIX experiment measures same and opposite sign baryon pairs in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV. Correlated production of $p$ and $\bar{p}$ with the trigger particle from the range 2.5 < $p_T$ < 4.0 GeV/$c$ and the associated particle with 1.8 < $p_T$ < 2.5 GeV/$c$ is observed to be nearly independent of the centrality of the collisions. Same sign pairs show no correlation at any centrality. The conditional yield of mesons triggered by baryons (and anti-baryons) and mesons in the same $p_T$ range rises with increasing centrality, except for the most central collisions, where baryons show a significantly smaller number of associated mesons. These data are consistent with a picture in which hard scattered partons produce correlated $p$ and $\bar{p}$ in the $p_T$ region of the baryon excess.
