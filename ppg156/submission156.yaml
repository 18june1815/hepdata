  We report a measurement of $e^{+}e^{-}$ pairs from semileptonic heavy-flavor decays in d+Au col-
lisions at √sN N = 200 GeV. Exploring the mass and transverse-momentum dependence of the
yield, the bottom decay contribution can be isolated from charm, and quantified by compari-
son to pythia and mc@nlo simulations. The resulting b ̄b-production cross section is σdAu
b ̄b =
1.37±0.28(stat)±0.46(syst) mb, which is equivalent to a nucleon-nucleon cross section of σN N
bb =
3.4 ± 0.8(stat)±1.1(syst) μb
