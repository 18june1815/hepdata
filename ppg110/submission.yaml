  We have measured the azimuthal anisotropy of $\pi^0$ for 1 < $p_T$ < 18 GeV/$c$ for Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV. The observed anisotropy shows a gradual decrease in 3 < $p_T$ < 7 - 10 GeV/$c$, but remains positive beyond 10 GeV/$c$. The magnitude of this anisotropy is under-predicted, up to at least 10 GeV/$c$, by current perturbative QCD (pQCD) energy-loss model calculations. An estimate of the increase in anisotropy expected from initial-geometry modification due to gluon saturation effects and initial-geometry fluctuations is insufficient to account for this discrepancy. Calculations which implement a path length dependence steeper than what is implied by current pQCD energy-loss models, show reasonable agreement with the data.
