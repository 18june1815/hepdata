    The invariant differential cross section for inclusive electron production in $p$+$p$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 200 GeV has been measured by the PHENIX experiment at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider over the transverse momentum range $0.4 \le p_T \le 5.0$ GeV/$c$ at midrapidity ($|\eta| \le$ 0.35). The contribution to the inclusive electron spectrum from semileptonic decays of hadrons carrying heavy flavor, $i.e.$ charm quarks or, at high $p_T$, bottom quarks, is determined via three independent methods. The resulting electron spectrum from heavy flavor decays is compared to recent leading and next-to-leading order perturbative QCD calculations. The total cross section of charm quark-antiquark pair production is determined as $\sigma_{c\bar{c}}$ = 0.92 $\pm$0.15 (stat.) $\pm$0.54 (sys.) mb.
