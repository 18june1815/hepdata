  We present measurements of electrons and positrons from the semileptonic decays of heavy- flavor hadrons at midrapidity (|$y$| < 0.35) in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 62.4 GeV. The data were collected in 2010 by the PHENIX experiment that included the new hadron-blind detector. The invariant yield of electrons from heavy-flavor decays is measured as a function of transverse momentum in the range 1 < $p^{e}_{T}$ < 5 GeV/$c$. The invariant yield per binary collision is slightly enhanced above the $p+p$ reference in Au+Au 0%-20%, 20%-40% and 40%-60% centralities at a comparable level. At this low beam energy this may be a result of the interplay between initial-state Cronin effects, final-state flow, and energy loss in medium. The $v_{2}$ of electrons from heavy-flavor decays is nonzero when averaged between 1.3 < $p^{e}_{T}$ < 2.5 GeV/$c$ for 0%-40% centrality collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 62.4 GeV. For 20%-40% centrality collisions, the $v_{2}$ at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 62.4 GeV is smaller than that for heavy flavor decays at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV. The $v_{2}$ of the electrons from heavy-flavor decay at the lower beam energy is also smaller than $v_{2}$ for pions. Both results indicate that the heavy-quarks interact with the medium formed in these collisions, but they may not be at the same level of thermalization with the medium as observed at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV.
