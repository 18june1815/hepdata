  Unpolarized cross sections and double-helicity asymmetries of single-inclusive positive and negative charged hadrons at midrapidity from $p$ + $p$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 62.4 GeV GeV are presented. The PHENIX measurement of the cross sections for 1.0 < $p_T$ < 4.5 GeV/$c$ are consistent with perturbative QCD calculations at next-to-leading order in the strong-coupling constant, $\alpha_s$. Resummed pQCD calculations including terms with next-to-leading-log accuracy, yielding reduced theoretical uncertainties, also agree with the data. The double-helicity asymmetry, sensitive at leading order to the gluon polarization in a momentum-fraction range of 0.05 $\lesssim$ $x_{gluon}$ $\lesssim$ 0.2, is consistent with recent global parametrizations disfavoring large gluon polarization.
