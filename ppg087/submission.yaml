comment: | # Information that applies to all data tables.
  The PHENIX experiment presents results from the RHIC 2006 run with polarized $p + p$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 62.4 GeV, for inclusive $\pi^0$ production at mid-rapidity. Unpolarized cross section results are measured for transverse momenta $p_T$ = 0.5 to 7 GeV/$c$. Next-to-leading order perturbative quantum chromodynamics calculations are compared with the data, and while the calculations are consistent with the measurements, next-to-leading logarithmic corrections improve the agreement. Double helicity asymmetries ALL are presented for $p_T$ = 1 to 4 GeV/$c$ and probe the higher range of Bjorken $x$ of the gluon ($x_g$) with better statistical precision than our previous measurements at $\sqrt{s}$ = 200 GeV. These measurements are sensitive to the gluon production in the proton for 0.06 < $x_g$ < 0.4.
