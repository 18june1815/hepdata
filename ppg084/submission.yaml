  Neutral pion transverse momentum ($p_T$) spectra at mid-rapidity ($|y|$ < 0.35) were measured in Cu+Cu collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 22.4, 62.4, and 200 GeV. Relative to $\pi^0$ yields in $p$+$p$ collisions scaled by the number of inelastic nucleon-nucleon collisions ($N_{coll}$) at the respective energies, the $\pi^0$ yields for $p_T$ $\ge$ 2 GeV/$c$ in central Cu+Cu collisions at 62.4 and 200 GeV are suppressed, whereas an enhancement is observed at 22.4 GeV. A comparison with a jet quenching model suggests that final state parton energy loss dominates in central Cu+Cu collisions at 62.4 GeV and 200 GeV, while the enhancement at 22.4 GeV is consistent with nuclear modifications in the initial state alone.
