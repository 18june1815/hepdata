  We present a detailed measurement of charged two-pion correlation functions in 0%-30% centrality $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV Au+Au collisions by the PHENIX experiment at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider. The data are well described by Bose-Einstein correlation functions stemming from Lévy-stable source distributions. Using a fine transverse momentum binning, we extract the correlation strength parameter $\lambda$, the Lévy index of stability $\alpha$ and the Lévy length scale parameter $R$ as a function of average transverse mass of the pair $m_{T}$. We find that the positively and the negatively charged pion pairs yield consistent results, and their correlation functions are represented, within uncertainties, by the same Lévy-stable source functions. The $\lambda$($m_{T}$) measurements indicate a decrease of the strength of the correlations at low $m_{T}$. The Lévy length scale parameter $R$($m_{T}$) decreases with increasing $m_{T}$, following a hydrodynamically predicted type of scaling behavior. The values of the Lévy index of stability $\alpha$ are found to be significantly lower than the Gaussian case of $\alpha$ = 2, but also significantly larger than the conjectured value that may characterize the critical point of a second-order quark-hadron phase transition.

description: 'Example fits of Bose-Einstein correlation functions of (a) $\pi^{-}\pi^{-}$ pair with $m_{T}$ between 0.331 and 0.349 GeV/$c^2$ and of (b) $\pi^{+}\pi^{+}$ pair with $m_T$ between 0.655 and 0.675 GeV/$c^2$, as a function $Q$ ≡ |$q_{LCMS}$|, defined in Eq. (26). Both fits show the measured correlation function and the complete fit function (described in VI A), while a Bose-Einstein fit function $C^{(0)}_{2} (Q)$ is also shown, with the Coulomb-corrected data, i.e. the raw data multiplied by $C^{(0)}_{2} (Q)/C_{2}(Q)$. In this analysis we measured 62 such correlation functions (for ++ and -- pairs, in 31 $m_T$ bins), and fitted all of them with the method described in VIA. The first visible point on both panels corresponds to $Q$ values below the accessible range (based on an evaluation of the two-track cuts), these were not taken into account in the fitting.'
