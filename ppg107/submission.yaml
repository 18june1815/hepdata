comment: |
  Measurements of double helicity asymmetries in inclusive hadron production in polarized $p + p$ collisions are sensitive to helicity-dependent parton distribution functions, in particular to the gluon helicity distribution, ∆g. This study focuses on the extraction of the double helicity asymmetry in $\eta$ production ($\vec{p}+\vec{p}$ → $\eta+X$), the $\eta$ cross section and the $\eta/\pi^0$ cross section ratio. The cross section and ratio measurements provide essential input for the extraction of fragmentation functions that are needed to access the helicity-dependent parton distribution functions.

# This is Figure 2.
name: "Figure 2"
location: Data from Figure 2 of Phys. Rev. D 83,032001 (2011)
description: Cross section for midrapidity inclusive of $\eta$ productions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 200 GeV as a function of $p_T$ and its comparison to NLO pQCD calculations at three different scales $\mu$. The error bars shown are the statistical and systematic uncertainties added in quadrature. Note that the fragmentation functions used in the calculations are partially constrained by this data.

# This is Figure 4.
name: "Figure 4"
location: Data from Figure 4 of Phys. Rev. D 83,032001 (2011)
description: Cross section ratio for the midrapidity production of inclusive $\eta$ to $\pi^0$ mesons at $\sqrt{s}$ = 200 GeV as a function of $p_T$. The error bars show the statistical and systematic uncertainties added in quadrature. The solid curve shows the ratio of the NLO pQCD calculations shown in Fig. 3 and the corresponding one for the $\pi^0$. The dashed curve shows the result of a PYTHIA Monte-Carlo simulation.

# This is Figure 5.

description: Double helicity asymmetry for midrapidity inclusive $\eta$ production from the combined 2005 and 2006 data at $\sqrt{s}$ = 200 GeV as a function of $p_T$. An additional 4.8% systematic uncertainty in the beam polarizations is not shown.
