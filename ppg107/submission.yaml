comment: |
  Measurements of double helicity asymmetries in inclusive hadron production in polarized $p + p$ collisions are sensitive to helicity-dependent parton distribution functions, in particular to the gluon helicity distribution, ∆g. This study focuses on the extraction of the double helicity asymmetry in $\eta$ production ($\vec{p}+\vec{p}$ → $\eta+X$), the $\eta$ cross section and the $\eta/\pi^0$ cross section ratio. The cross section and ratio measurements provide essential input for the extraction of fragmentation functions that are needed to access the helicity-dependent parton distribution functions.
