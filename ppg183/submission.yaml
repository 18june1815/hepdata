  Measurements of anisotropic flow Fourier coefficients ($v_n$) for inclusive charged particles and identified hadrons $\pi^{\pm}$, $K^{\pm}$, $p$, and $\bar{p}$ produced at midrapidity in Cu + Au collisions at $\sqrt{S_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV are presented. The data were collected in 2012 by the PHENIX experiment at the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider (RHIC). The particle azimuthal distributions with respect to different-order symmetry planes $\Psi_n$, for n = 1, 2, and 3 are studied as a function of transverse momentum $p_T$ over a broad range of collision centralities. Mass ordering, as expected from hydrodynamic flow, is observed for all three harmonics. The charged-particle results are compared with hydrodynamical and transport model calculations.We also compare these Cu + Au results with those in Cu + Cu and Au + Au collisions at the same $\sqrt{S_{NN}}$ and find that the $v_2$ and $v_3$, as a function of transverse momentum, follow a common scaling with 1/($\epsilon_n N_{part}^{1/3}$).
