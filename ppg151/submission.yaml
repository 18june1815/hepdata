  We present results for three charmonia states ($psi^{\prime}$, $\chi_c$ and $J/\psi$) in $d$+Au collisions at $|y|$ < 0.35 and $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV. We find that the modification of the $\psi^{\prime}$ yield relative to that of the $J/\psi$ scales approximately with charged-particle multiplicity at midrapidity across $p$+$A$, $d$+Au, and $A$+$A$ results from the Super Proton Synchrotron and the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider. In large impact-parameter collisions we observe a similar suppression for the $\psi^{\prime}$ and $J/\psi$, while in small impact-parameter collisions the more weakly bound $\psi^{\prime}$ is more strongly suppressed. Owing to the short time spent traversing the Au nucleus, the larger $\psi^{\prime}$ suppression in central events is not explained by an increase of the nuclear absorption due to meson formation time effects.
