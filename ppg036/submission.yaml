    We report on charged hadron production in deuteron-gold reactions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV. Our measurements in the deuteron-direction cover 1.4 < $\eta$ < 2.2, referred to as forward rapidity, and in the gold-direction -2.0 < $\eta$ < -1.4, referred to as backward rapidity, and a transverse momentum range $p_T$ = 0.5 - 4.0 GeV/$c$. We compare the relative yields for different deuteron-gold collision centrality classes. We observe a suppression relative to binary collision scaling at forward rapidity, sensitive to low momentum fraction $(x)$ partons in the gold nucleus, and an enhancement at backward rapidity, sensitive to high momentum fraction partons in the gold nucleus.
