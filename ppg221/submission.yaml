    Asymmetric nuclear collisions of $p$+Al, $p$+Au, $d$+Au, and $^3$He+Au at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV provide an excellent laboratory for understanding particle production, as well as exploring interactions among these particles after their initial creation in the collision. We present measurements of charged hadron production $dN_{ch}/d\eta$ in all such collision systems over a broad pseudorapidity range and as a function of collision multiplicity. A simple wounded quark model is remarkably successful at describing the full data set. We also measure the elliptic flow $v_2$ over a similarly broad pseudorapidity range. These measurements provide key constraints on models of particle emission and their translation into flow.
