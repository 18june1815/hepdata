  'Measurements of the fractional momentum loss ($S_{loss}$ â‰¡ $\delta p_T/p_T$) of high-transverse-momentum identified hadrons in heavy ion collisions are presented. Using $\pi^0$ in Au+Au and Cu+Cu collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 62.4 and 200 GeV measured by the PHENIX experiment at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider and and charged hadrons in Pb+Pb collisions measured by the ALICE experiment at the Large Hadron Collider, we studied the scaling properties of $S_{loss}$ as a function of a number of variables: the number of participants, $N_{part}$, the number of quark participants, $N_{qp}$, the charged particle density, $dN_{ch}/d \eta$, and the Bjorken energy density times the equilibration time, $\epsilon B_j \tau_0$. We find that the $p_T$ , where Sloss has its maximum, varies both with centrality and collision energy. Above the maximum, Sloss tends to follow a power-law function with all four scaling variables. The data at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV and 2.76 TeV, for sufficiently high particle densities, have a common scaling of $S_{loss}$ with $dN_{ch}/d \eta$ and $\epsilon B_j \tau_0$, lending insight on the physics of parton energy loss.'
