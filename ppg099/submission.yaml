  The PHENIX experiment at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider has measured the invariant differential cross section for production of $K^0_S$, $\omega$, $\eta^{prime}$, and $\phi$ mesons in $p$+$p$ collisions at = 200 GeV. Measurements $\omega$ and $\phi$ production in different decay channels give consistent results. New results for the $\phi$ are in agreement with previously published data and extend the measured $p_T$ coverage. The spectral shapes of all hadron transverse momentum distributions measured by PHENIX are well described by a Tsallis distribution functional form with only two parameters, $n$ and $T$, determining the high-$p_T$ and characterizing the low-$p_T$ regions of the spectra, respectively. The values of these parameters are very similar for all analyzed meson spectra, but with a lower parameter $T$ extracted for protons. The integrated invariant cross sections calculated from the fitted distributions are found to be consistent with existing measurements and with statistical model predictions.
