  The PHENIX experiment at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider has measured the invariant differential cross section for production of $K^0_S$, $\omega$, $\eta^{\prime}$, and $\phi$ mesons in $p$+$p$ collisions at = 200 GeV. Measurements $\omega$ and $\phi$ production in different decay channels give consistent results. New results for the $\phi$ are in agreement with previously published data and extend the measured $p_T$ coverage. The spectral shapes of all hadron transverse momentum distributions measured by PHENIX are well described by a Tsallis distribution functional form with only two parameters, $n$ and $T$, determining the high-$p_T$ and characterizing the low-$p_T$ regions of the spectra, respectively. The values of these parameters are very similar for all analyzed meson spectra, but with a lower parameter $T$ extracted for protons. The integrated invariant cross sections calculated from the fitted distributions are found to be consistent with existing measurements and with statistical model predictions.

description: 'Cross sections in mb and $<p_T>$ in GeV/$c$ of different particles in $p$+$p$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 200 GeV. PHENIX columns show the values obtained by fits to the experiment spectra with the Tsallis functional form as described in the text. One should state explicitly that these values do not supersede values given in the ”Published” column by the experiments, in their publications listed in the last column, or elsewhere. An additional 9.7% systematic uncertainty should be added to all $d\sigma$/$dy$ values listed in the column “PHENIX” to account for the trigger uncertainties. Values in the column “Published” are also given without these systematic uncertainties. The column “S.M.” is the prediction of the statistical model discussed in the text. The characteristic widths of the particle spectra are $\langle p_T \rangle$ for all species except for $J/\psi$ and $\psi^{\prime}$ for which the values given in the Table are $\langle p_T^2 \rangle$. For $\psi^{\prime}$ the integration is done in the $p_T$ regionbelow 5 GeV/$c$. All errors are the combined statistical and systematic uncertainties.'
