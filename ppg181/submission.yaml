  We present the first measurement of elliptic ($v_2$) and triangular ($v_3$) flow in high-multiplicity $^3$He+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV. Two-particle correlations, where the particles have a large separation in pseudorapidity, are compared in $^3$He+Au and in $p$+$p$ collisions and indicate that collective effects dominate the second and third Fourier components for the correlations observed in the $^3$He+Au system. The collective behavior is quantified in terms of elliptic $v_2$ and triangular $v_3$ anisotropy coefficients measured with respect to their corresponding event planes. The $v_2$ values are comparable to those previously measured in $d$+Au collisions at the same nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energy. Comparison with various theoretical predictions are made, including to models where the hot spots created by the impact of the three $^3$He nucleons on the Au nucleus expand hydrodynamically to generate the triangular flow. The agreement of these models with data may indicate the formation of low-viscosity quark-gluon plasma even in these small collision systems.
