  We present measurements of the $J/\psi$ invariant yields in $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 39 and 62.4 GeV Au+Au collisions at forward rapidity (1.2 < $|y|$ < 2.2). Invariant yields are presented as a function of both collision centrality and transverse momentum. Nuclear modifications are obtained for central relative to peripheral Au+Au collisions ($R_{CP}$) and for various centrality selections in Au+Au relative to scaled $p$+$p$ cross sections obtained from other measurements ($R_{AA}$). The observed suppression patterns at 39 and 62.4 GeV are quite similar to those previously measured at 200 GeV. This similar suppression presents a challenge to theoretical models that contain various competing mechanisms with different energy dependencies, some of which cause suppression and others enhancement.
