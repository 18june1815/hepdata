  Fast parton probes produced by hard scattering and embedded within collisions of large nuclei have shown that partons suffer large energy loss and that the produced medium may respond collectively to the lost energy. We present measurements of neutral pion trigger particles at transverse momenta $P^t_T = 4-12$ GeV/$c$ and associated charged hadrons ($P^a_T = 0.5-7$ GeV/$c$) as a function of relative azimuthal angle $\Delta\phi$ at midrapidity in Au+Au and $p$+$p$ collisions at $\sqrt{S_{NN}}=200$ GeV. These data lead to two major observations. First, the relative angular distribution of low momentum hadrons, whose shape modification has been interpreted as a medium response to parton energy loss, is found to be modified for $P^t_T < 7$ GeV/$c$. At higher $P^t_T$, the data are consistent with unmodified or very weakly modified shapes, even for the lowest measured $P^a_T$. This observation presents a quantitative challenge to medium response scenarios. Second, the associated yield of hadrons opposite to the trigger particle in Au+Au relative to that in $p$+$p$ ($I_{AA}$) is found to be suppressed at large momentum ($I_{AA} \approx 0.35-0.5$), but less than the single particle nuclear modification factor ($R_{AA} \approx 0.2$).
