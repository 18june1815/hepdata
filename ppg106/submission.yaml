  Hard-scattered parton probes produced in collisions of large nuclei indicate large partonic energy loss, possibly with collective produced-medium response to the lost energy. We present measurements of $\pi^0$ trigger particles at transverse momenta $p^t_T$ = 4–12 GeV/$c$ and associated charged hadrons ($p^a_T$ = 0.5–7 GeV/$c$) vs relative azimuthal angle $\Delta \phi$ in Au + Au and $p$ + $p$ collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV. The Au + Au distribution at low $p^a_T$, whose shape has been interpreted as a medium effect, is modified for $p^t_T$ < 7 GeV/$c$. At higher $p^t_T$, the data are consistent with unmodified or very weakly modified shapes, even for the lowest measured $p^a_T$, which quantitatively challenges some medium response models. The associated yield of hadrons opposing the trigger particle in Au + Au relative to $p$ + $p$ ($I_{AA}$) is suppressed at high $p_T$ ($I_{AA}$ $\approx$ 0.35–0.5), but less than for inclusive suppression ($R_{AA}$ $\approx$ 0.2).
