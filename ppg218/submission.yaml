  We present measurements of elliptic and triangular azimuthal anisotropy of charged particles detected at forward rapidity 1 < |$\eta$| < 3 in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV, as a function of centrality. The multiparticle cumulant technique is used to obtain the elliptic flow coefficients $v_2${2}, $v_2${4}, $v_2${6}, and $v_2${8}, and triangular flow coefficients $v_3${2} and $v_3${4}. Using the small-variance limit, we estimate the mean and variance of the event-by-event $v_2$ distribution from $v_2${2} and $v_2${4}. In a complementary analysis, we also use a folding procedure to study the distributions of $v_2$ and $v_3$ directly, extracting both the mean and variance. Implications for initial geometrical fluctuations and their translation into the final state momentum distributions are discussed.
