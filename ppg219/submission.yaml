  The PHENIX collaboration has measured high-$p_T$ dihadron correlations in $p$+$p$, $p$+Al, and $p$+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV. The correlations arise from inter- and intra-jet correlations and thus have sensitivity to nonperturbative effects in both the initial and final states. The distributions of $p_{out}$, the transverse momentum component of the associated hadron perpendicular to the trigger hadron, are sensitive to initial and final state transverse momenta. These distributions are measured multi-differentially as a function of $x_E$, the longitudinal momentum fraction of the associated hadron with respect to the trigger hadron. The near-side $p_{out}$ widths, sensitive to fragmentation transverse momentum, show no significant broadening between $p$+Au, $p$+Al, and $p$+$p$. The away-side nonperturbative $p_{out}$ widths are found to be broadened in $p$+Au when compared to $p$+$p$; however, there is no significant broadening in $p$+Al compared to $p$+$p$ collisions. The data also suggest that the away-side pout broadening is a function of $N_{coll}$, the number of binary nucleon-nucleon collisions, in the interaction. The potential implications of these results with regard to initial and final state transverse momentum broadening and energy loss of partons in a nucleus, among other nuclear effects, are discussed.
