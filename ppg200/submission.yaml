  We have measured direct photons for $p_T$ < 5 GeV/$c$ in minimum bias and 0% - 40% most central events at midrapidity for Cu+Cu collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV. The $e^+e^−$ contribution from quasi-real direct virtual photons has been determined as an excess over the known hadronic contributions in the $e^+e^−$ mass distribution. A clear enhancement of photons over the binary scaled $p$+$p$ fit is observed for $p_T$ < 4 GeV/$c$ in Cu+Cu data. The $p_T$ spectra are consistent with the Au+Au data covering a similar number of participants. The inverse slopes of the exponential fits to the excess after subtraction of the $p$+$p$ baseline are 285 $\pm$ 53(stat) $\pm$ 57(syst) MeV/$c$ and 333 $\pm$ 72(stat) $\pm$ 45(syst) MeV/$c$ for minimum bias and 0% - 40% most central events, respectively. The rapidity density, $dN/dy$, of photons demonstrates the same power law as a function of $dN_{ch}/d$\eta$ observed in Au+Au at the same collision energy.
