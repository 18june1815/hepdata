comment: |
  The transverse momentum dependence of the azimuthal anisotropy parameter $v_2$, the second harmonic of the azimuthal distribution, for electrons at midrapidity ( $|\eta| < 0.35$) has been measured with the PHENIX detector in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=200. The measurement was made with respect to the reaction plane defined at high rapidities ( $|\eta|$ = 3.1â€”3.9). From the result we have measured the $v_2$ of electrons from heavy flavor decay after subtraction of the $v_2$ of electrons from other sources such as photon conversions and Dalitz decay from light neutral mesons. We observe a nonzero single electron $v_2$ with a 90% confidence level in the intermediate- $p_T$ region. The precision of the present data set does not permit us to conclude definitively that heavy quarks exhibit thermalization with the transverse flow of the bulk matter.
