  The PHENIX experiment at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider has measured the differential cross section of $\phi$(1020)-meson production at forward rapidity in $p$ + $p$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 510 GeV via the dimuon decay channel. The partial cross section in the rapidity and $p_T$ ranges 1.2 < |y| < 2.2 and 2 < $p_T$ < 7 GeV/$c$ is $\sigma_{\phi}$ = [2.28 $\pm$ 0.09(stat) $\pm$ 0.14 (syst) $\pm$ 0.27 (norm)] * $10^{-2}$ mb. The energy dependence of $\sigma_{\phi}$ (1.2 < |y| < 2.2; 2 < $p_T$ < 5 GeV/$c$) is studied using the PHENIX measurements at $\sqrt{s}$ = 200 and 510 GeV and the Large Hadron Collider measurements at $\sqrt{s}$ = 2.76 and 7 TeV. The experimental results are compared to various event generator predictions (PYTHIA6, PYTHIA8, PHOJET, AMPT, EPOS3, and EPOS-LHC).
