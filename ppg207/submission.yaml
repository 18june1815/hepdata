  We present measurements of the transverse-momentum dependence of elliptic flow $v_2$ for identified pions and (anti)protons at midrapidity ($|\eta|$ < 0.35), in 0%-5% central $p$+Au and $^3$He+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV. When taken together with previously published measurements in $d$+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV, the results cover a broad range of small-collision-system multiplicities and intrinsic initial geometries. We observe a clear mass-dependent splitting of $v_2$($p_T$) in $d$+Au and $^3$He+Au collisions, just as in large nucleus-nucleus ($A$+$A$) collisions, and a smaller splitting in $p$+Au collisions. Both hydrodynamic and transport model calculations successfully describe the data at low $p_T$ (< 1.5 GeV/$c$), but fail to describe various features at higher $p_T$. In all systems, the $v_2$ values follow an approximate quark-number scaling as a function of the hadron transverse kinetic energy per constituent quark($KE_T$/$n_q$), which was also seen previously in $A$+$A$ collisions.
