  PHENIX has measured the $e^{+}e^{-}$ pair continuum in $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=200 GeV Au+Au and $p+p$ collisions over a wide range of mass and transverse momenta. The $e^{+}e^{-}$ yield is compared to the expectations from hadronic sources, based on PHENIX measurements. In the intermediate mass region, between the masses of the $\phi$ and the $J/\psi$ meson, the yield is consistent with expectations from correlated $c\bar c$ production, though other mechanisms are not ruled out. In the low mass region (below the $\phi$) the $p+p$ inclusive mass spectrum is well described by known contributions from light meson decays. In contrast, the Au+Au minimum bias inclusive mass spectrum in this region shows an enhancement by a factor of $4.7\pm 0.4^{stat}\pm 1.5^{syst}\pm 0.9^{model}$ At low mass ($m_{ee}$<0.3 GeV/$c^{2}$) and high $p_{T}$ (1<$p_{T}$<5 GeV/$c$) an enhanced $e^{+}e^{-}$ pair yield is observed that is consistent with production of virtual direct photons. This excess is used to infer the yield of real direct photons. In central Au+Au collisions, the excess of the direct photon yield over the $p+p$ is exponential in $p_{T}$, with inverse slope $T = 221\pm 19^{stat}\pm 19^{syst}$ MeV. Hydrodynamical models with initial temperatures ranging from $T_{init} \cong$300--600 MeV at times of 0.6--0.15 fm/$c$ after the collision are in qualitative agreement with the direct photon data in Au+Au. For low $p_{T}$<1 GeV/$c$ the low mass region shows a further significant enhancement that increases with centrality and has an inverse slope of $T\cong$100 MeV. Theoretical models under predict the low mass, low $p_{T}$ enhancement. Error values of 9.99E+9 represent upper limit errors.

description: 'Subtracted $p_{T}$ spectrum in 300-750 compared to calculations from Elena Bratkovskaya. $p_{T}$ spectra of $e^{+}e^{−}$ pairs for 0.3 < $m_{ee}$ < 0.75 GeV/$c^{2}$ in Min. Bias Au + Au collisions compared to the expectations from the calculations of respectively R. Rapp and van Hees [15, 18, 83], Dusling and Zahed [19, 84, 85], Cassing and Bratkovskaya [20, 27, 86, 87]. The spectra are fully acceptance corrected. The curves show separately partonic and hadronic yields. For the curves of Rapp and van Hees [15, 18, 83] the two scenarios: Hadron Many Body Theory (HMBT) and Dropping Mass (DM) are shown. The sum is calculated with HMBT. The calculations are compared to the data from which the contributions of the cocktail of hadronic decays and charmed meson decays have been subtracted.'
