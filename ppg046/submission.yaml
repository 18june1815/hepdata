    The azimuthal distribution of identified $\pi^0$ and inclusive photons has been measured in $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV Au+Au collisions with the PHENIX experiment at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The second harmonic parameter ($v_2$) was measured to describe the observed anisotropy of the azimuthal distribution. The measured inclusive photon $v_2$ is consistent with the value expected for the photons from hadron decay and is also consistent with the lack of direct photon signal over the measured $p_T$ range 1 - 6 GeV/$c$. An attempt is made to extract $v_2$ of direct photons.
