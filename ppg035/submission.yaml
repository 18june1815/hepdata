    The PHENIX experiment has measured mid-rapidity transverse momentum spectra (0.4 < $p_T$ < 4.0 GeV/$c$) of single electrons as a function of centrality in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV. Contributions to the raw spectra from photon conversions and Dalitz decays of light neutral mesons are measured by introducing a thin (1.7% $X_0$) converter into the PHENIX acceptance and are statistically removed. The subtracted "non-photonic" electron spectra are primarily due to the semileptonic decays of hadrons containing heavy quarks (charm and bottom). For all centralities, charm production is found to scale with the nuclear overlap function, $T_{AA}$. For minimum-bias collisions the charm cross section per binary collision is $N_{c\bar{c}}$/$T_{AA}$ = 622 $\pm$ 57 (stat.) $\pm$ 160 (sys.) $\mu$barns.
