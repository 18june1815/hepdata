  BNL-RHIC. The PHENIX collaboration presents first measurements of low-momentum (0.4< $p_T$ <3 GeV/c)direct-photon yields from Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=39 and 62.4 GeV. For both beam energies thedirect-photon yields are substantially enhanced with respect to expectations from prompt processes,similar to the yields observed in $Au+Au$ collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=200.  Analyzing the photon yield as afunction of the experimental observabledNch/d?reveals that the low-momentum (>1 GeV/c) direct-photon yielddNdir?/d?is a smooth function of $dN_{ch}/d\eta$ and can be well described as proportionalto $(dN_{ch}/d\eta)^\alpha$ with $\alpha\approx1.25$. This scaling behavior holds for a wide range of beam energies at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider and the Large Hadron Collider, for centrality selected samples, as well  as  for  different, $A+A$ collision systems. At a given beam energy the scaling also holds for high $p_T$(>5 GeV/c) but when results from different collision energies are compared, an additional $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$-dependent multiplicative factor is needed to describe the integrated-direct-photon yield.
