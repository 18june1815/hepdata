  The standard model (SM) of particle physics is spectacularly successful, yet the measured value of the muon anomalous magnetic moment ${(g-2)}_{\mu}$ deviates from SM calculations by 3.6$\sigma$. Several theoretical models attribute this to the existence of a "dark photon," an additional U(1) gauge boson, which is weakly coupled to ordinary photons. The PHENIX experiment at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider has searched for a dark photon, $U$, in $\pi^0$,$\eta \rightarrow \gamma e^+e^-$ decays and obtained upper limits of $O$(2*10-6) on $U$-$\gamma$ mixing at 90% C.L. for the mass range 30 < $m_U$ < 90 MeV/$c^2$. Combined with other experimental limits, the remaining region in the $U$-$\gamma$ mixing parameter space that can explain the ${(g-2)}_{\mu}$ deviation from its SM value is nearly completely excluded at the 90% confidence level, with only a small region of 29 < $m_U$ MeV/$c^2$ remaining.
