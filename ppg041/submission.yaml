comment: We present transverse momentum ($p_T$) spectra of charged hadrons measured in deuteron-gold and nucleon-gold collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 200 \mathrm{GeV}$ for four centrality classes. Nucleon-gold collisions were selected by tagging events in which a spectator nucleon was observed in one of two forward rapidity detectors. The spectra and yields were investigated as a function of the number of binary nucleon-nucleon collisions, $\nu$, suffered by deuteron nucleons. A comparison of charged particle yields to those in $p+p$ collisions show that the yield per nucleon-nucleon collision saturates with $\nu$ for high momentum particles. We also present the charged hadron to neutral pion ratios as a function of $p_T$.
