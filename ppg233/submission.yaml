comment: |
  Small nuclear collisions are mainly sensitive to cold nuclear effects, however, the collective behavior observed in these collisions shows a hint of hot nuclear effects. The identified particle spectra, especially the $\phi$ mesons which contains strange and anti-strange quarks and has a relatively small hadronic interaction cross section, are a good tool to study these effects. The PHENIX experiment has measured $\phi$ mesons in a unique set of small collision systems $p$$+$Al, $p$$+$Al, $^3$He$+$Au at $\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}=200$ GeV. The transverse momentum spectra and nuclear modification factors are presented and compared to theoretical model predictions. The comparisons with different calculations suggest that quark-gluon plasma may be formed in the small collision systems at $\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}=200$ GeV. However, the volume and the lifetime of the medium produced in small collision systems may be insufficient for observing strangeness enhancement and jet quenching effects. The comparison with AMPT calculations suggests that the main production mechanisms of $\phi$ mesons may be different in $p$$+$Al collisions and $p/d/^3$He$+$Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}=200$ GeV at midrapidity. While thermal quark recombination seems to dominate in $p/d/^3$He$+$Au, fragmentation seems to be the main production mechanism in $p$$+$Al.
