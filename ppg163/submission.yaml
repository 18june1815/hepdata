  We report on $J/{\psi}$ production from asymmetric Cu+Au heavy-ion collisions at $\sqrt{S_{NN}}$=200 $GeV$ at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider at both forward (Cu-going direction) and backward (Au-going direction) rapidities. The nuclear modification of $J/{\psi}$ yields in Cu+Au collisions in the Au-going direction is found to be comparable to that in Au+Au collisions when plotted as a function of the number of participating nucleons. In the Cu-going direction, $J/{\psi}$ production shows a stronger suppression. This diverence is comparable in magnitude and has the same sign as the diverence expected from shadowing effects due to stronger low-$x$ gluon suppression in the larger Au nucleus. The relative suppression is opposite to that expected from hot nuclear matter dissociation, since a higher energy density is expected in the Au-going direction.
