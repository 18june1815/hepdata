  The second Fourier component $v_2$ of the azimuthal anisotropy with respect to the reaction plane was measured for direct photons at midrapidity and transverse momentum ($p_T$) of 1-13 GeV/$c$ in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV. Previous measurements of this quantity for hadrons with $p_T$ < 6 GeV/$c$ indicate that the medium behaves like a nearly perfect fluid, while for $p_T$ > 6 GeV/$c$ a reduced anisotropy is interpreted in terms of a path-length dependence for parton energy loss. In this measurement with the PHENIX detector at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider we find that for $p_T$ > 4 GeV/$c$ the anisotropy for direct photons is consistent with zero, as expected if the dominant source of direct photons is initial hard scattering. However, in the $p_T$ < 4 GeV/$c$ region dominated by thermal photons, we find a substantial direct photon $v_2$ comparable to that of hadrons, whereas model calculations for thermal photons in this kinematic region significantly underpredict the observed $v_2$.
