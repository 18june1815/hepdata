  BNL-RHIC.  Suppression of the J/$\psi$ nuclear modification factor has been seen as a trademark signature of final state effects in large collision systems for decades. In small systems, the nuclear modification was attributed to cold nuclear matter effects until the observation of strong differential suppression of the $\psi$(2S) state in $p/d$+A collisions suggested the presence of final state effects. Results of J/$\psi$ and $\psi$(2S) measurements in the dimuon decay channel are presented here for $p$+$p$, $p$+Al, and $p$+Au collision systems at $\sqrt{s_NN} = 200$~GeV. The results are predominantly shown in the form of the nuclear modification factor, $R_{AB}$, the ratio of the  $\psi$(2S) invariant yield per nucleon-nucleon collision in collisions of proton on target nucleus to that in $p$+$p$ collisions. Measurements of the J/$\psi$ and $\psi$(2S) nuclear modification factor are compared with shadowing and transport model predictions, as well as to complementary measurements at Large-Hadron-Collider energies.
