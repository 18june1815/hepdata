  We present measurements of $J/\psi$ yields in $d$+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV recorded by the PHENIX experiment and compare with yields in $p$ + $p$ collisions at the same energy per nucleon-nucleon collision. The measurements cover a large kinematic range in $J/\psi$ rapidity (−2.2 < $y$ < 2.4) with high statistical precision and are compared with two theoretical models: one with nuclear shadowing combined with final state breakup and one with coherent gluon saturation effects. In order to remove model dependent systematic uncertainties we also compare the data to a simple geometric model. We find that calculations where the nuclear modification is linear or exponential in the density weighted longitudinal thickness are difficult to reconcile with the forward rapidity data.
