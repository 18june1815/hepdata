    Identified $\pi^{±}$, $K^{±}$, $p$, and $\bar{p}$ transverse momentum spectra at mid-rapidity in $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 130 GeV Au + Au collisions were measured by the PHENIX experiment at RHIC as a function of collision centrality. Average transverse momenta increase with the number of participating nucleons in a similar way for all particle species. Within errors, all mid-rapidity particle yields per participant are found to be increasing with the number of participating nucleons. There is an indication that $K^{±}$, $p$ and $\bar{p}$ yields per participant increase faster than the $\pi^{±}$ yields. In central collisions at high transverse momenta ($p_T$ $>$ 2 GeV/$c$), $p$ and $\bar{p}$ yields are comparable to the $\pi^{±}$ yields.
