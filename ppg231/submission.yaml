  BNL-RHIC-PHENIX.  The cross section of bottom quark-antiquark ($b\bar{b}$) production in $p$$+$$p$ collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=510 GeV is measured with the PHENIX detector at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider. The results are based on the yield of high mass, like-sign muon pairs measured within the PHENIX muon arm acceptance $(1.2<|y|<2.2)$. The $b\bar{b}$ signal is extracted from like-sign dimuons by utilizing the unique properties of neutral $B$ meson oscillation. We report a differential cross section of $d\sigma_{b\bar{b}\rightarrow \mu^{\pm}\mu^{\pm}}/dy$=$0.16 \pm 0.01$ (stat)$\pm0.02$ (syst)$\pm0.02$ (global) nb for like-sign muons in the rapidity and $p_{T}$ ranges $1.2<|y|<2.2$ and $p_{T}>1$ GeV/c, and dimuon mass of $5$-$10$ GeV/$c^{2}$. The extrapolated total cross section at this energy for $b\bar{b}$ production is $13.1 \pm 0.6 $(stat)$\pm 1.5$ (syst)$\pm 2.7$ (global) $\mu b$. The total cross section is compared to a perturbative quantum chromodynamics calculation and is consistent within uncertainties. The azimuthal opening angle between muon pairs from $b\bar{b}$ decays and their $p_{T}$ distributions are compared to distributions generated using PS PYTHIA6, which includes next-to-leading order processes. The azimuthal correlations and pair $p_{T}$ distribution are not very well described by PYTHIA calculations, but are still consistent within uncertainties. Flavor creation and flavor excitation subprocesses are favored over gluon splitting.
