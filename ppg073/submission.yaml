  Differential elliptic flow ($v_2$) for $\phi$ mesons and (anti)deuterons ($\bar{d}$)$d$ is measured for Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV. The $v_2$ for $\phi$ mesons follows the trend of lighter $\pi^{\pm}$ and $K^{\pm}$ mesons, suggesting that ordinary hadrons interacting with standard hadronic cross sections are not the primary driver for elliptic flow development. The $v_2$ values for ($\bar{d}$)$d$ suggest that elliptic flow is additive for composite particles. This further validation of the universal scaling of $v_2$ per constituent quark for baryons and mesons suggests that partonic collectivity dominates the transverse expansion dynamics.
