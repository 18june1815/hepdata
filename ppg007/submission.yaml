## TODO:
## Centrality binning for fig. 2a needs to be fixed
## Add back in missing data points from fig 1
## Remember to ask about centrality binning  and extra data points in Fig. 1b, uncertainty in Fig. 1a with weird point

comment: | # preserve newlines
  Data from Au $+$ Au interactions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 130\ GeV$, obtained with the PHENIX detector at RHIC, are used to investigate local net charge fluctuations among particles produced near mid-rapidity. According to recent suggestions, such fluctuations may carry information from the Quark Gluon Plasma. This analysis shows that the fluctuations are dominated by a stochastic distribution of particles, but are also sensitive to other effects, like global charge conservation and resonance decays.
