  Data from Au $+$ Au interactions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 130\ GeV$, obtained with the PHENIX detector at RHIC, are used to investigate local net charge fluctuations among particles produced near mid-rapidity. According to recent suggestions, such fluctuations may carry information from the Quark Gluon Plasma. This analysis shows that the fluctuations are dominated by a stochastic distribution of particles, but are also sensitive to other effects, like global charge conservation and resonance decays.

## TODO:  - figure out what's going on with the variable cardinality between 4v(Q) & v(R).
##        - cast 4v(Q) and v(R) together for the time being (if you can).
