    Transverse momentum spectra of charged hadrons with $p_T$ < 8 GeV/$c$ and neutral pions with $p_T$ < 10 GeV/$c$ have been measured at mid-rapidity by the PHENIX experiment at RHIC in $d$+$Au$ collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV. The Measured yields are compared to those in $p$+$p$ collisions at the same $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ scaled up by the number of underlying nucleon-nucleon collisions in $d$+$Au$. The yield ratio does not show the suppression observed in central $Au$+$Au$ collisions at RHIC. Instead, there is a small enhancement in the yield of high momentum particles.
