abstract:

The PHENIX Collaboration has measured the ratio of the yields of $\Psi$(2S) to $\Psi$(1S)mesons produced in $p$ + $p$, $p$ + Al, $p$ + Au, and ${}^{3}$He+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV over the forward and backward rapidity intervals 1.2 < |y| < 2.2. We find that the ratio in $p$ + $p$ collisions is consistent with measurements at other collision energies. In collisions with nuclei, we find that in the forward ($p$-going or ${}^{3}$He-going) direction, the relative yield of $\Psi$(2S) mesons to $\Psi$(1S) mesons is consistent with the value measured in $p$ + $p$ collisions. However, in the backward (nucleus-going) direction, the $\Psi$(2S) meson is preferentially suppressed by a factor of âˆ¼2. This suppression is attributed in some models to the breakup of the weakly bound $\Psi$(2S) meson through final-state interactions with comoving particles, which have a higher density in the nucleus-going direction. These breakup effects may compete with color screening in a deconfined quark-gluon plasma to produce sequential suppression
of excited quarkonia states.

TABLE II. The charged-particle multiplicity $dN_{ch}/d\eta$ determined from AMPT simulations and the nuclear overlap $S_T$ from Glauber simulations for the data shown in Fig. 5. Here we assume $dN/d\eta$ = $\frac{3}{2}dN_{ch}/d\eta$.

Howdy, PPG188 for review.

I spent a lot of time trying to best figure how to partition the data. This is my best approach. Please let me know if there is a better way to do this.

Table 1b is separate from Table 1a since the values of the intermediate steps (independent variables treated as dependent variables) are so much greater than the dependent variable (in Table 1a) and effectively would dominate in a single plot.

The intermediate steps are not really independent secondary variables. Maybe those plots should not be included?

Note that the rapidity intervals 1.2<y<2.2 and -2.2<y<-1.2 (in Table I) are not continuous bins and therefore require separate documents.

Similar considerations for Table II.

Thank you!
