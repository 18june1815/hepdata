 The PHENIX Collaboration has measured the ratio of the yields of $\Psi$(2S) to $\Psi$(1S) mesons produced in $p$ + $p$ --> CHARGED X, $p$ + Al --> CHARGED X, $p$ + Au --> CHARGED X, 3He + Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV over the forward and backward rapidity intervals 1.2 < |y| < 2.2. We find that the ratio in $p$ + $p$ collisions is consistent with measurements at other collision energies. In collisions with nuclei, we find that in the forward ($p$-going or ${}^{3}$He-going) direction, the relative yield of $\Psi$(2S) mesons to $\Psi$(1S) mesons is consistent with the value measured in $p$ + $p$ collisions. However, in the backward (nucleus-going) direction, the $\Psi$(2S) meson is preferentially suppressed by a factor of ~2. This suppression is attributed in some models to the breakup of the weakly bound $\Psi$(2S) meson through final-state interactions with comoving particles, which have a higher density in the nucleus-going direction. These breakup effects may compete with color screening in a deconfined quark-gluon plasma to produce sequential suppression of excited quarkonia states.
