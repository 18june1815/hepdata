  PHENIX measurements are presented for the cross section and double-helicity asymmetry (ALL) in inclusive $\pi^0$ production at midrapidity from $p$ + $p$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 510 GeV from data taken in 2012 and 2013 at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider. The next-to-leading-order perturbative-quantum-chromodynamics theory calculation is in excellent agreement with the presented cross section results. The calculation utilized parton-to-pion fragmentation functions from the recent DSS14 global analysis, which prefer a smaller gluon-to-pion fragmentation function. The $\pi^0$ $A_{LL}$ results follow an increasingly positive asymmetry trend with $p_T$ and $\sqrt{s}$ with respect to the predictions and are in excellent agreement with the latest global analysis results. This analysis incorporated earlier results on $\pi^0$ and jet $A_{LL}$ and suggested a positive contribution of gluon polarization to the spin of the proton $\Delta G$ for the gluon momentum fraction range $x$ > 0.05. The data presented here extend to a currently unexplored region, down to $x$ $\sim$ 0.01, and thus provide additional constraints on the value of $\Delta G$.
